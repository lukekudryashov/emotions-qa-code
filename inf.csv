3,2552587,Swollen lump w/pain to touch and strange discomfort in lower abdomen/pelvic region.?,"I had not noticed anything at all and have become slightly bothered now without any information as to -what- it could be. Help?
The lump is slightly larger than 1 inch long, in an oval shape about 3/4-1inch thick.  I would guess the volume of about 1cubic inch total. It's hard, not squishy, and doesn't move more than a hair in any direction. It seems to be fine until I touch it. It's not like 'ouch!' painful, just tender. The skin around it is smooth and red, stretched a bit.  It's located dead-center between my belly button and gential area. Doesn't seem to be a lymphnode but I am not that familiar with lymphnodes.  When I gently pressed around it I noticed also that above my genital region the whole area (size of palm) is puffy. My lower gut and the general problem area has kind of had this faint ache sensation move through it quickly and then go away. I am not otherwise having problems. Any idea what this is, or could be? I really can't afford to see a doctor.","Lymph nodes are located off to the sides, not dead center in the abdomen.  I'm betting on a hernia.  Please read more about it here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia

Because you are female, this could certainly be something more profound and I agree with the others... you can't afford NOT to go to the doctor.  

Call your local Health Department, explain your situation, ask if there is a free or low cost way to be seen in your city/county.  If you experience intense pain, discomfort, fever or additional swelling, go to the Emergency Room and tell them that you have no insurance, but would like to speak with a social worker to see if you qualify for assistance or bill reduction.

Keep in mind that while it might cost a bit at this point, it will probably only get worse later, risk your health to a large degree and certainly won't get less expensive to treat... only more complex.

I will tell you that this does NOT sound like anything I can think of that would go away on its own.  Even fibroids would probably move a bit when you touch the area.  Hernias can be quite dangerous if they go untreated, so please make arrangements to be seen by a qualified physician.

Yesterday you were out shooting some baskets or maybe playing some touch football when you made this sudden turn and heard a soft ""pop."" Soft popping sounds don't usually get you excited, but this one came from your knee. The next thing you knew, your hands were wrapped around that rascal and your eyes were filled with tears of pain.
Today you woke up with swelling, tenderness, radiating pain, and perhaps some discoloration and loss of motion.
What kind of damage could have occurred? Well, there are basically three common forms of destruction to choose from: torn cartilage, a torn ligament, or both.
What should you do about it: That's easy. Put it on ice and go to a doctorï¿½today.

But still I don't have any further information and I would really really appreciate some help from a doctor who knows about this...","Sounds like you could have injured your ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) or your meniscus. Both are internal structures of the knee which likely explains the swelling of the knee. Sometimes you will experience instablility, locking, catching, etc. 
 Right know you should ice the knee and keep it elevated. Within the next week or so I would recommend seeing an orthopedist or primary care sports med physician. There is a good chance they will order an MRI of the knee to determine if something was indeed torn. If so, then options are surgery or physical therapy. Which you option you and the doc choose depends on your age, level of activity, extent of injury, etc.
  I hope this helps.","swelling, tenderness, radiating pain, and perhaps some discoloration and loss of motion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I got this ^^^^ information from google and it pretty much describes my situation with my knee.

Don't cut him cold turkey, both alcohol and cigarettes are addictive, and you are just asking him to sneak around behind your back to indulge his habits.

As far as snacks go, the best thing to do IS to have small snacks between your meals and before bed.  That keeps your metabolism going.

---------------------------------
Edit:
Regarding the latter posters and allergic reactions:
It's a common misconception that nausea and vomiting is a sign of an allergic reaction, it's not, it's a normal however undesirable side effect of the drug. Most drugs have such side effects along with headache, dizzyness and somnolence. Allergic reactions are caused when the body's  immune system attacks a normally harmless substance (the allergen). The immune system calls upon a protective antibody called immunoglobulin E or IgE to fight these invading substances. The large IgE release ends up causing mast cells to be injured or irritated and they release a variety of strong chemicals, including histamine, into the tissues and blood. This causes the itching, swelling, and fluid leaking from nearby cells. These chemicals cause the familiar signs of an allergic reaction that we all recognize,  itching, airway and throat tightening, hay fever and allergic rhinitis to name just a few.",Nausea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Is it the Percoset?

    plzzzzzzz reply me if u r a docter or good adviser","Conditions associated with pectus excavatum include Marfan syndrome, Poland syndrome, and Pouter pigeon breast:

Marfan syndrome

The Marfan syndrome is a connective tissue disorder. Connective tissue provides substance and support to tendons, ligaments, blood vessel walls, cartilage, heart valves and many other structures. In the Marfan syndrome, the chemical makeup of the connective tissue isn't normal. As a result, many of these structures aren't as stiff as they should be.

The Marfan syndrome is inherited and affects many parts of the body. There's no single conclusive test for diagnosing it, but people who have it often have many similar traits. Besides perhaps having heart problems, people with the Marfan syndrome are often tall and thin. They also may have slender, tapering fingers, long arms and legs, curvature of the spine and eye problems. Sometimes the Marfan syndrome is so mild that few (if any) symptoms exist. In the most severe cases, which are rare, life-threatening problems may occur at any age.

Poland syndrome

Poland syndrome consists of a deficiency of subcutaneous fat and muscles on one side of the body. It may include underdevelopment of the arm, hand, and fingers on the same side, and may be associated with other conditions such as Moebius syndrome or Klippel-Feil syndrome. The right side of the body is affected twice as often as the left.

It is difficult to determine how many individuals are affected by Poland syndrome, since mild cases may go unnoticed or be misdiagnosed. One study estimated that it may occur in 1 in 30,000 individuals. Poland syndrome does seem to affect males more commonly than females.

Symptoms
Poland syndrome has several distinctive symptoms:

    * Chest muscle deformities - absence of the pectoralis minor and the breastbone part of the pectoralis major
    * Undedevelopment or absence of breast or nipple on the affected side
    * Patchy absence of hair under the arm on the affected side 

Additional symptoms on the affected side may include:

    * Underdeveloped or missing ribs
    * Underdeveloped arm, hand, and fingers
    * Abnormally short, webbed fingers
    * Small, elevated scapula (shoulder bone), called Sprengel deformity",increse my weght.,,,,last 3 years i havn't any kind of growth in my weight.,weight,,,,,"last 3 month my docter doing ,getting money & give some tablets.no more i can  wait ...",my docter,,,,,,,,, but it makes only some pus pimple. ~~~,2000 extra colores from nuts per each day,my doctor said weight management is not depent on PE.,my docter,,,Yes: any disease had such a symptoms??????or are these the hormon disease?,,,,,,Other: NA,,,

Why were the dogs taken away? Perhaps it was because the owners could no longer take care of them?

My cousin got her breast reduction, tummy tuck and facelift surgery in India by the company called Forerunners Healthcare .The Price for the surgery she paid in India was very less. She paid 30% of the cost she was quoted in America.

Forerunners Healthcare is very famous in India. They arrange cosmetic and plastic surgery for foreigners in India. I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and about their patient stories. They arrange financing for USA, Canadian, UK and other international patients who plan to have surgery abroad for low price, as the breast reduction, tummy tuck, facelift and other cosmetic surgery is not covered by insurance. They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. There are huge cost savings. As a doctor I personally believe that surgery can be easily handled in India, as the quality of healthcare available In India is simply best in the world. The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star.

Different cancers, of course, have different survivabilities.  ""Stage 3"" does not always mean imminent death; in fact (using an example), a majority of people with certain blood lymphomas can be cured at stage 3.

The month I was scheduled to have an hystersalpingogram (hsg) test, I got pregnant and now I am in my second trimester with a healthy baby in-utero.

I would suggest you ask your doctor about an hsg test. Basically the procedure involves shooting dye up your cervix, uterus and fallopian tubes. They then take an xray to check for blockages. Blockages are a major contributing factor for infertility in endo patients. The great thing about this test is that often times, the act of shooting the dye up into the fallopian tubes will clear them out enough to allow the sperm to enter and fertilize an egg and then allow the egg passage back to the uterus.

My husband and I decided to try one last time before the test and we used pre-seed which is a sperm friendly lubricant. It was the first and only time we had ever used this product-and low and behold two weeks later I had a positive hpt. If you are interested, just google ""preseed"" and you should find it.

There are no blood tests, brain scans, or psychological tests that definitively diagnose it.  There are many combinations of cognitive and behavioral problems that may exist.  ).  Symptoms of this syndrome may include: Poor impulse control and internal self-monitoring, attention inconsistencies, chronic procrastination, the need for instant gratification, poor organizational skills, hyperactivity and hypoactivity, poor peer relationships, poor concept of time, and the need for highly stimulating activities.

Failure to treat ADHD carries significant risks whose lifelong consequences are well known: Failure to get an
education, poor self?esteem, substance abuse, and antisocial behaviors that become habitual and can contribute to failure at life.

ADD/ADHD is not an imaginary disorder.  It is a chronic developmental disorder which is genetically based.  It is not a learning disability, but can co?exist with learning disabilities in approximately 25 to 33 percent of those diagnosed with ADD/ADHD.

40,4334189,Is weight loss surgery healthy?,"That is the best way I have found to phrase this question.  I tried asking this question yesterday but I do not think I phrased it right so I did not get the answers I was looking for.

I am curious as to it being unhealthy compared to anorexia.  I understand that anorexia is a mental disorder.  I also understand that weight loss surgery is not.  But is the limited food intake comparable to anorexia?  I understand that a large person cannot be anorectic, because being anorectic involves having distorted image of ones self.  Isn't rapid weight loss a sign of anorexia?  And isn't the rapid weight loss a result of not being able to eat, either physically or emotionally, wouldn't that be considered anorexia also?

I am not trying to be disrespectful, I am just trying to understand this.  I have struggled with an eating disorder in the past, and I have  friends who  had weight loss surgery.  I see them acting the same ways as I have in the past.  I want to notice if something is wrong.","Weight Loss surgery is not healthy and it should only be used for the morbidly obese (in other words if they dont get the surgery they will die in five years). Too many people are getting the gastric bypass surgeries as an easy fix. And the doctors are eager to give them since they and the hospital makes big bucks. They say they council these men and women but they still offer them so much more that the fear is subdued.

Here is the problems with Weight Loss Surgery:
You could die on the table
You could die later from complications
You could die from malnourishment
You can have many illnesses from lack of nutition
You dont do well in pregnancy since it is hard for the baby to get 
      the nourishment it needs
Your stomach can stretch back out over time if you overeat
For a long time you can only eat a Tablespoon of food at a time
      eat more than that or rich food and you throw up. Many 
      surgery patients throw up alot.
You are on supplements the rest of your life
This surgery is irreversible, so if you dont like your life after
       you dont have a choice. No going back.
These patients lose all joy surrounding food (parties, dinner out)
This surgery is not natural for your body.

These are just a few reasons to find another way. Anorexia is not the answer either as it also has many health risks. The best way to lose weight is to eat less, exercise, eat more natural diet, and be happy (sadness and depression cause weight gain).

Hoodia is a good natural pill (derived from cactus in Africa) to supress the appetite to get the fat off. As the fat comes off you will naturally eat less and better. You can do Weight Watchers as it is the most tested of all plans and it works. Never try to lose more than 2-3 lbs per week or you will gain it back plus some. Slow is the best. Weight only once a week as that is the only time it is acurrate (water weight).
Then to keep it off, just do your weekly weight in and if it is up, cut back a little for the week.

Change you life, be healthy and remember weight is not gained in a day.",weight loss surgery.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I have struggled with an eating disorder in the past, and I have  friends who  had weight loss surgery.

41,2616250,I'm afraid of vomit... what should I do?,"Don't laugh... I have had this fear of vomit and vomiting since I was a kid.  I panic whenever I think someone near me is about to vomit, if someone in the vicinity has already started vomiting, or if someone has just vomited.

I can't stand the smell/sight/sound of vomit or someone vomiting... it seriously scares me a lot, and I go into fight-or-flight mode: I get very tense, jittery, light-headed, and my heart races.

I am also afraid of myself vomiting.  Aside from an unfortunate incident in college when I had a little too much to drink, I haven't vomited since I was 7, and I'm 24 now.

I'm somewhat afraid to hold babies because I'm afraid they're going to vomit on me, although a baby vomiting isn't quite as scary as a child or adult vomiting.  At the same time though, I really want to have kids someday.  How can I care for kids (especially when they're sick) if I'm so afraid of them vomiting?

i know this is gonna sound scary, but the way i got over it was by vomiting!!!  after it happened a couple times in my adult life, i realized it was a whole lot less terrible and frightening than i remembered.

me....","Right now you are having a panic attack! Chill out! Take some deep breaths,and relax. I answered some of your other questions,please go back and look at my responses.

Heartburn can cause pain like angina at times,BUT so can an anxiety or panic attack. I personally have experienced anxiety attacks,and my last one,in particular I swore i was having a heart attack. You may need to go to the doctor or emergency room for an accurate diagnosis and treatment. 

Obviously there is something going on with you right now,but try to relax and calm down. Tell yourself that you will be ok. If you can't drive yourself,call someone to take you in to the ER. There are meds to treat anxiety,heartburn and angina...BUT,you need to find out what is really causing you to feel this way first.

46,84151,Metal  Clips Showing Up In X ray?,"My friend had an xray taken recently in the er because she was having pains in her lower belly. The xray is showing two metal clip like things. She was told that they could have came from her c section or tubal ligation. Now the thing is she is not only having pain in this area but she has been getting headaches,backaches, and numbness in her legs. And when she goes through metal detectors she sets them off. We were told by the cop that passed her over with a wand once and whom we had told that she would set them off because of the metal surgical clips that the clips should not set the alarms off cause they are suppose to be made of titanium and that does not set their metal detectors off. So why is she setting off the metal detectors then?","titanium is still a metal, therefore, the metal detectors are just doing their job. The difference is, she shouldn't be setting off the alarms when she leaves the stores. The clips she is seeng are more likely from her tubal proceedure than her c-section though. However, the fact that she has other symptoms warrants attention. She needs to figure out if she has an injury or infection that is causing them. How new is her tubal?

When it reaches that point, I find it difficult to even get in a comfortable position.

You've certainly brought your medical concerns to the right place! The Y!A community members are fully aware of and do appreciate the intimate conditions involving your prognosis.
Most recognized doctors in the field of medicine would employ a holistic approach to your ailment. Lisa, please begin your day with a well balanced breakfast to include an ample portion of fruits and grains. After your morning routines are finished, enjoy a brisk walk around the block. If you happen to meet any stray dogs along the way, it would be a good idea to antagonize the creatures in order to add some vigor to your workout.
Now Lisa, the remaining portions of your day should be filled with interesting activities and new studies to keep your mind active and in balance, complimentary to what you have done with the physical side of yourself.
After loitering around at the public library all afternoon with a bunch of smelly hobos, you can appreciate a warm bath and time to be good to yourself. Begin to collect an archive of various music genres that you can resolve one day to enjoy after you get the rest of your chores done.
Lisa, if after following my advice, simply take two aspirin and forget we ever had this little discussion.
Thank you, Lisa. Have a great day!

It could also be that your gallbladder is inflamed and causing the pain.

I am only 30 years old. I don't have alot of experience with drugs, but I know that these aren't working.

You are awfully young for osteoporosis - are you on medications to help with that?  Have you considered surgical intervention for the knees?  It is better to fix the underlying problem than to try and treat the symptom (pain).

Long term use of narcotics can cause you to not only become tolerant, but to develop extreme sensitivity to pain - things that don't normally cause pain might feel painful to you (opiate-induced hypersensitivity)

I would consult a pain management specialist with the goal of getting off narcotics completely.  Contact your local hospital's anesthesia department for a referral.

For example, my goal several years ago was to graduate from college.  I started out and I really found myself struggling and sinking rather than being able to stay afloat.  I failed a class in college after being an A student in high school.  I realized that setting a goal as abstract as ""graduate from college"" was not going to help me.  I needed to focus on the here and now.  So I had a goal of graduating from college, but I set a more specific objective that for the current semester I would get straight A's no matter how much work it took.  I focused on this objective each semester and I actually managed to succeed in obtaining straight As in all of my classes and graduated college as the valedictorian commencement speaker for a graduating class of thousands of students.  Clearly I had not only met my goal ,but exceeded what I ever could have imagined doing.  Like you, I had mental health issues, and while I didn't get into any legal troubles, I never sought out the help I needed which would have eased my load a lot over the years.

My advice to you would be narrow your focus on the here and now.  It's great to have long-term aspirations, but what are you going to do right now to help you get there... you need to plan out where you want your life to be in one day, one month, one year, etc.  No one wakes up one morning and magically has all of their hopes and dreams come true.  Through hard work and many, many failures you begin to make progress toward your dreams.  It's not easy and when you combine a mental illness with attaining your dreams, it makes it that much more difficult.  Not impossible by any means.  You need to start by sitting down and thinking not about what your dreams are (because clearly you already know), but rather figure out what you need to do to get there.  Suddenly you will feel that your life has direction and purpose and YOU WILL SUCCEED.  

I also want to applaud you for getting the help you need for your psychological issue.  You have more strength to do that than many people, including myself.  That is a great first step in achieveing your desires and in working with your therapist, you will undoubtedly be able to further develop your plans of how you are going to reach your dreams.  

I wish you nothing but the best in your quest for your dreams.  Go for it and know that at times you will fail, but you look back at that, learn one thing from it, and move on.

However, now, my psoriasis has gotten out of control.  I am using Aclovate on it, as it has spread to my face, and is pretty bad.

26,3365546,What are the Causes of Oral Bone Loss?,"Hi,
As my doctor sent me to a specialist to understand the cause of my gum recession, I was told (by the specialist) that the main problem is the bone loss.  In my case, the gum just follows the bone.  Essentially he wants to do a deep cleaning as a way of slowing the bone loss. I am having a problem accepting that plaques and caveties are the reason for my oral bone loss. I am not sure I feel convinced as I have been flossing since I ever remember.  I never bleed when cleaning my teeth.   My mother has lost all her teeth very early in life and I am thinking this is more genetic than any thing else.

I would really appreciate any answer (link to any article, books ...)
How effective is deep cleaning for preventing oral bone loss?
How much your genes and caveties contribute to bone loss?

I am a male, 40s from Middle Eas decent.

Thanks.","I'm a registered dental hygienist. your ? is kind of conflicting (which i completely understand as you do not have   a degree in the dental field!!!) gum recession can be caused by agressive toothbrushing, a ""high muscle"" attachment (called a frenum), and yes bone loss. generally, patients who need a ""deep cleaning"" are overdue for their rountine cleaning, or don't have optimum oral hygiene (i.e. brushing, flossing, etc). and yes, genetics have A LOT to do w/ this. (cavities, however, are NOT related at all). if your chief concern is gum recession, a ""deep cleaning"" is not necessarily the answer. HOWEVER, it may have been your chief concern, but upon exam by the periodontist, you may need a deep cleaning to help w/ bone levels. did the periodontist ""measure"" your gums at all? or talk about any numbers? generally, a deep cleaning is needed when 4 teeth in each ""quadrant"" of your mouth (upper/lower, left/right) have at least one 4mm ""pocket"" or deeper. did the periodontist tell you that you have ""tarter"" or ""calculus"" buildup on your teeth? hope this makes sense.",Oral Bone Loss,35-44 years old,Male,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, I am having a problem accepting that plaques and caveties are the reason for my oral bone loss.

Finally woke up with no idea what has happened to her.  This has happen on a number of times.  Each time with no warning and more sever.  She is now being sent to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesaota for further study.  She is placed on life support each time and has a permanent trek in her throat to help keep her breathing which they found does not stop these episodes.,"MG is an ascending disorder, meaning that it would start in her brain and SLOWLY work its way down. if the first thing that she experienced was the trachea closing off, then it's possible that it's not MG. For it to be classically symptomatic of MG she would have had to have had the trachea closing first THEN the heart ceasing to beat next followed by her lungs ceasing to inflate and deflate and so on. Usually there are signs that MG is a diagnosis for symptoms that include confusion and declining motor function first, as the brain controls this, and anything else after that.
MG is completely diagnosable. The test is called the Tensilon Test, basically the drug Tensilon is given and if there is a positive response, ie, her throat opens back up and her heart beat returns to it's usual, she has MG and a more permanent treatment is started. All in all, good luck with everything, and if it is MG and not something else, be happy, it's a perfectly treatable disease!",vocal cords freezing,,,,She became unconscious and her heart stop beating. ,Myasthia Gravis,,,This has happen on a number of times.

35,2092774,Does anyone have experiece/know of treatment options for chiari?,"Hello, I was wondering if anyone has had experience with chiari and knew of any treatments. My boyfriend (he is 20) has just been diagnosed with the disease (has off-and-on, mild to severe headaches) and friends and family are trying to find out as much as possible. 

He has seen a neurosurgeon, but he said the only option was surgery, with a bovine skull replacement, or just deal w/ the headaches (unless neurological signs begin). It seemed like a pretty hollistic view. His mom has already found out the bovine skull is not necessary for the surgury.

He is going in for a second opinion in LA and have a MRI of the spine as well. I was just wondering if anyone else had experience with this and knew of other ways to treat it? Some of the info is vague, I'm not sure if it is type 1 or 2, and the cyst is about 4 cm large right now :/ Thanks so much in advance, and any help is greatly appreciated!","Treatment Options for Chiari Malformation
Neurologists and neurosurgeons at Mayo Clinic take a conservative approach to treating Chiari malformation to spare patients unnecessary surgery that will not alleviate their symptoms. While many people may have a subtle Chiari malformation that is evident on an MRI, few malformations are serious enough to warrant treatment.

The goal of treatment is to halt or reverse the progression of signs and symptoms. This may be accomplished by surgery to relieve the pressure on the brain stem, cerebellum and spinal cord, and to re-establish spinal fluid circulation.

The surgical procedure (posterior fossa craniectomy or posterior fossa decompression), involves removing a small section of bone at the back of the head to relieve pressure by making more room for the cerebellum. The covering of the brain (dura) may also be enlarged with a patch created from synthetic material or tissue from the patient's leg muscle. This helps make more room for the brain and the spinal cord and helps to establish the flow of cerebral spinal fluid. The operation generally takes two to three hours. Recovery time in the hospital could take from two to four days.

A cervical laminectomy is also performed. This involves the removal of the bone forming the back of the vertebra or lamina. Both the posterior fossa decompression and the cervical laminectomy are done at the same time, through the same surgical incision in the back of the head and upper neck.

Occasionally, the surgery may be modified if there is a syrinx (fluid-filled cavity in the spinal cord) present or if the patient has hydrocephalus. Most patients who have the surgery do quite well and their symptoms improve.

Surgery performed on patients who can truly benefit from the operation often successfully relieves the symptoms of Chiari malformation.",treatment options for chiari,,Female,,,,,," My boyfriend (he is 20) has just been diagnosed with the disease (has off-and-on, mild to severe headaches) and friends and family are trying to find out as much as possible.

38,4400405,I have had tonsil stones all my life and cant seem to get rid of them -in the last 4 years ....?,they have effected the quality of my voice and I cant sing as well cause I loose my voice alot -or atleast I believe they are the cause of this - will getting my tonsils removesd help my voice or is there something I can do to make the tonsil stones go away -please only answer if you know what they are or have them your self -they happen to be very common though most people have them and dont know it -I didn't know what they were until four years ago mayself but ahad wondered for years- Please help if you know what I can do about them - they are getting out of control -I sometimes spit out 5 to 10  a week !!!,"Just to back you up...they do exist!  ANd here are some ideas....not sure what you have tried.
Most people swallow this material without ever noticing it, while it is still tiny. In those whose tonsils are large, however, the particles can lodge in the deep crypts, where they continue to grow. The enlarging lumps are called calculi of the tonsil, or tonsilloliths (tonsil stones). These stones are most common during adolescence.

Microscopic studies of these tonsilloliths have shown them to contain a combination of food particles, bacteria, oral debris, and white blood cells in a concentrically laminated pattern -- rather like a pearl. Usually they are small gritty particles found in the center of soft, cheesy flecks. Sometimes, however, they become quite large, appearing as rough, yellow or gray, round stones. At times they reach an extraordinary size. Affected people usually have a history of repeated attacks of tonsillitis in earlier years.

Most people with calculi of the tonsils have no associated symptoms. In that case nothing need be done, except perhaps for brushing or scraping them out, as your daughter does. Gargling, refraining from eating during the 30 minutes before falling asleep, and careful oral hygiene may help minimize their formation.

For some people, however, the calculi can be quite bothersome, causing a constant foreign-body sensation, a chronic low-grade sore throat, recurrent episodes of tonsillitis persisting beyond childhood, or chronic bad breath.

Treatment consists of either removing the tonsils or removing the calculi. Troublesome large calculi that are not easily dislodged may need an ear, nose, and throat doctor to remove them.  http://www.drgreene.com/21_568.html
Tonsil Stones don't do any physical harm, and sporadically coughing them up doesn't mean that there is anything wrong. However, they can be annoying and sometimes they are an indication that you have bad breath. Normally, Normally one does not do much for them, except gargle with hydrogen peroxide. A simple combination of drugs and nasal drops can effectively eliminate tonsil stones without unnecessary tonsil surgery. Plus, occasional use of a nasal spray helps neutralise the anaerobic sulfur-producing bacteria on contact.   http://www.doctorndtv.com/topicsh/Tonsil%20stones.asp
The only sure-fire method for ridding yourself of this problem is to have your tonsils removed (tonsillectomy), but there are nonsurgical alternatives which you should certainly pursue before you ask an ENT to take out your tonsils:
 You could try gargling frequently with warm salt water (1 teaspoon of table salt mixed with one pint of water gargle with about 1/4 cup of this mixture three times per day, after meals.)
 You could also gargle with a mouthwash called Alkalol, which is essentially salt water combined with a variety of natural aromatic extracts; some people prefer Alkalol to plain salt water. Most other commercial mouthwashes contain sugar or alcohol, which are pleasant-tasting but are, in the long run, fairly irritating if used frequently.
 There is a doctor in Los Angeles, Murray Grossan, who markets a water-jet device for ""hosing down"" the tonsils. Relative to gargling, this device provides a more aggressive technique for clearing out those nasty crypts.
 In the hopes of avoiding tonsillectomy, I will often put my patient on a long (3 to 4 week) course of antibiotics in the hope that this will allow the tonsils to ""settle down"" (become less inflamed.) I must admit that antibiotics are not a very effective cure for this problem.  http://www.doctorhoffman.com/xlith.htm

Okay, you've said that augmentin helped you. When I ran a quick search, I found it was related to penicillin. So that means that you're probably still dealing with some very stubborn infections.

Try drinking cranberry juice. At the very least, it shouldn't hurt (unless you're allergic). And it has been shown to be effective against a number of harmful bacteria. Try eating and drinking to boost your immune system. That might also help your energy problem- and as uncomfortable as you are, I would be surprised if you were resting.

As far as clips/staples are concerned, yes those are left in all the time. Clips are used to stop bleeding, and there are all kinds of stapling devices used in intestinal surgeries--and the appendix is just a part of the large intestine.

59,3046890,Is this a sesamoid bone injury?,"About 7-8 months ago, I fell and injured a bone in my foot. There was a hard boney lump at the injury and it swelled for a few days but I ignored it up until now. The swelling went away, but the boney bump never did, neither did the pain. This past weekend, I fell and re-injured the same spot, again causing it to swell. The swelling has gone away again, but the pain is terrible!! I can barely walk. I went to the Dr and she initially thought it was a broken bone that healed incorrectly and then calcified. Now after looking at the x-rays, she thinks it is a Sesamoid bone irritation. After checking online, I just don't think this sounds correct. The lump is on the inner part of the arch of my foot, but towards the top of the foot, not the sole.

This is a common track injury and it hurts like h*ll. One thing you can be sure of, is that with rest, it will eventually shrink, unless it's already developed calcification deposits. First, I think your Dr is right about her diagnosis. Second, prepare yourself for the possibility of minor surgery to remove the bump.

'need an answer' you state you are a medical professional. All I can say is thank god I dont have anything to do with you. What a closed mind. As someone also in the medical profession, what you allude to certainly does happen however you are being extremely judgemental here, and remember it's the internet here. sounds like you are purely siding with the doctor.... people usually do that to protect their own.

I prefer to have an open mind and treat each patient as an individual, have in my mind the potential reasons why patients have complications... but assess each case on it's own merits.

'treefrog' - nice answer. Hope you are going well.

To help the person asking this question however ----

Sepsis and septic infection literally means an infection around the site.. which has the potential to travel around the body and cause many more serious problems. It is not uncommon to have infections after a surgery. The professionals involved do everything they can to reduce the risk however  they cannot reduce the risk to zero. We all have bugs that live on our skin happily, healthily fighting off other viruses and bugs that we come into contact with. It's when these bugs get into your system, into a spot they shouldnt that they cause trouble. The treatment you have undegone is fairly standard for your condition and complication ( in regards to the antibiotics) It is vitally important that the infection get under control so that your knee surgery can finally be finished.

However if you had told me this story... I would have the following concerns - 

1. Sounds like the doctor, by what you describe here, isnt listening to you, or is... but not allaying your fears. that is all about communication. If potentially he isnt hearing what you are saying, or not explaining things properly because you may be too upset to listen properly, my suggestion is to take a friend along to your next appointment. Have a list of questions written down and ask them, one by one. Do not give your doctor the list, just ask them the way you have written them - its your list, you need to understand it.

2. The doctor removing medication from your handbag. I am afraid no professional has the right to do this. The medication is legally prescribed, you have had it legally dispensed from a pharmacist, it has your name on it. It is yours. My question here to him would be... why did you do that... why havent you sent them to me... If he thinks you may be starting to have an addiction to pain medication... then he has handled it poorly. Communication is the key again. He has taken your pain medication and not sent it.... maybe I can jump to conclusions like 'need an answer' did and say the doctor is taking the medication himself and he is addicted????

Assumptions dont help. Getting you comfortable and pain free and on the right treatment is the goal here.

Take a friend along, ask the questions, if you dont get satisfactory answers, then seek a second opinion. Maybe it isnt your fault, but a fault of the doctor in question.

After all.... we are all human. sometimes everyone needs to be reminded of that.

Any help would be appreciated!","This should have been arranged before your appointment. It is up to your doctor to order and schedule both tests. To show up and expect that the MRI technologist will just do both is very inconsiderate of the patients that will follow your appointment as a MRI usually takes  about 45 minutes and this will cause all the patients after you to be at least an hour late with their appointments.  If there is an open spot after your knee scheduled time, the tech can call your doctor and ask if it can be done, but this should have been brought up by you at your appointment with the ordering doctor. Many times, a reputable doctor will not order a test as expensive as an MRI without examining the patient.

OR, you can call the doctor before your appointment and have BOTH tests scheduled at once. You may have to switch days to do this, but it seems to be the best option.

There are some things I've learned from docs, some from painful experience, here they are; front to back motion is ok, it's the side to side that will get you.  Lifting is not good, but, remember, DDD is tricky and what you do today will probably not show up for 3 days, so you really have to pay attention to what you're doing and see how you feel 3 days from now (this is really hard to do).  DDD gets worse with time, so what you do this year that doesn't bother you may bother you next year.  The best way to keep your back in shape is; you have to exercise both your back AND your stomach muscles.  You need to have both the back and the front of your torso in good shape.

My research through Google tells me that it is not curable. How do I stop the itching? Is there anyone with this problem who can give me some help? I have suffered for the past 8 months and I am frustrated. Doctors prescribe lotions and the 5 different prescriptions do not help. Anyone who can provide me with information that might be helpful would have my sincerest gratitude. 

Thank you.","Moisturizers- Moisturizers or emollients including bath oils, soap substitutes can be applied to the dermatitis as frequently as required to relieve itching, scaling and dryness. Emollients should also be used on the unaffected skin to reduce dryness. Emollient therapy helps to restore one of the skin's most important functions, which is to form a barrier to prevent bacteria and viruses getting into the body and therefore help to prevent a rash becoming infected. Emollients are safe and rarely cause an allergic reaction. Occasionally, products with lanolin may cause a reaction. Ideally, moisturizers should be applied three to four times a day. Apply in a gentle downward motion in the direction of hair growth to prevent accumulation of cream around the hair follicle (this can cause infection of the follicle).

Coal Tar- Coal tar has been used to treat the itching and inflammation caused by skin conditions for hundreds of years. The tar contains chemicals that soothe the skin. Crude coal tar is a byproduct of oil production. It makes the skin more sensitive to light. In its natural state it is a thick, brownish-black substance that is messy to apply to the skin. Refined coal tar preparations, many of which are available over the counter, may be more cosmetically acceptable. Coal tar has been used for many years to treat psoriasis and it has few side effects. However, it does not work for everyone. In addition to being messy to use, it has a strong odor and can stain skin and clothing. It can cause sun sensitivity, and may irritate acute dermatitis. Tar creams or bath emulsions can be helpful for mild inflammation of atopic dermatitis. The smell may be offensive to some people.

Corticosteroids / Topical steroids ï¿½ Topical steroid medications are one of the most common treatments for mild to moderate psoriasis. They reduce redness (inflammation) and itching and stop the rapid build-up of dead skin cells. They come in varying strengths, from weak to highly potent. They are available as creams, gels, lotions, ointments, or solutions. A steroid mousse is now available to treat scalp psoriasis. Topical steroids can become less effective if used repeatedly for a long time. This is called resistance. The best outcome may be achieved when topical steroids are combined with other medications applied to the skin. Steroids in the form of pills or injections are generally not used to treat psoriasis because they have too many serious side effects. Also, psoriasis can come back worse than ever when treatment stops. Long-term use of potent topical steroids on large areas of skin can produce side effects such as stretch marks, thinning and reddening of the skin, and the appearance of small blood vessels through the skin. These medications should not be put on the face or on areas of the body where the skin folds, such as the armpits, groin, and webs of the toes. Use of steroid ointments and creams requires good judgment and careful supervision. They come in various strengths from mild to super-potent. Ask the doctor about potency and side effects of prescribed corticosteroid medicines. Corticosteroid medicines are prescribed for atopic dermatitis to calm the inflamed skin. Avoid combination topical steroid/antifungal cream in the treatment of diaper rash.

Topical Immunomodulators- Topical immunomodulators (TIMs) are a new type of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug for the treatment of eczema. Mild burning sensations have been reported when applying TIMs. In general, however, TIMs have fewer side effects than corticosteroids. TIMs are topical drugs that modulate the immune response (alter the reactivity of cell-surface immunologic responsiveness). Studies have shown that this class of drugs will improve or completely clear eczema in more than 80 percent of treated patients, with a side-effect profile comparable with topical steroids.

If anyone has any recipes that are an easy way to get a decent amount of iron, I'd really appreciate them.  Or just reccomendations for foods to eat.  Thanks a bunch!","One simple way is to cook in cast iron pots.  If you cook acidic foods for a long time, you will get a *big* increase in the iron content of the food, in a form that your body can digest more easily than that in supplements.  I would suggest making some long-cooking tomato sauce.

In addition, liver is high in iron.  However, it is the organ that cleanses the blood of the animal, so it may be high in pollutants that aren't good for you at any time--especially when you're pregnant.  If you can get organic liver, I'd say go for it.

Other foods that have iron include green vegetables (broccoli and kale in particular; spinach and other green leafy vegetables also have iron, but in a very poorly-absorbed form), egg yolks, and whole grains (avoid all white flour and white rice).

Eating vitamin C foods together with your iron-rich foods also helps absorption.

102,1482978,"HPV, getting pregnant and chance of miscarrages?","I have HPV and have had two coloposcopies with another one scheduled for the 28th. I have also had the LEEP procedure done once. I know the HPV never goes away, but I was wondering if anyone who has had LEEP or other HPV/abnormal Pap/mild dysplasia treatments done who have had problems either conceiving or carrying a baby to term? Does it hinder conception or does it cause early miscarriages? Can it still be treated during pregnancy?","HPV is unlikely to affect your pregnancy or your baby's health. If you have genital warts, they may grow faster during pregnancy, possibly from the extra vaginal discharge that provides the virus with a moist growing environment, hormonal changes, or changes in your immune system. In most cases they won't pose any problems for you or your baby.

It's possible for you to pass the virus to your baby, but this doesn't happen very often. Even if your child does contract HPV, he's likely to overcome it on his own without any symptoms or problems. In the unlikely event that he gets the type of HPV that causes genital warts, he may develop warts on his vocal cords and other areas sometime in infancy or childhood. This condition, called recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, is very serious, but fortunately it's also rare. 

There's no drug that can get rid of the virus. If you have warts, your practitioner may decide not to treat them during your pregnancy, because they often get better on their own or even disappear altogether after you give birth.There are various treatments, however, that can be used to remove the warts safely during pregnancy.

If your practitioner decides removal is necessary, she may use a special acid solution, freeze them off with a liquid nitrogen solution, or remove them by laser, by electrocautery, or surgically. (Two prescription products that women apply themselves are used to treat genital warts, but they're generally not recommended during pregnancy. And don't ever try to treat genital warts with drugstore medications meant for common warts.)

If your Pap smear is abnormal, your practitioner may examine your cervix and vagina with a special microscope in a procedure called colposcopy. (A colposcopy is no more uncomfortable than a Pap, though it takes longer.) If she sees suspicious changes in your cells, she may take a biopsy of the tissue, which can cause some temporary discomfort and bleeding.

If there's no evidence of invasive cancer, your practitioner will most likely wait until after you give birth to further treat the abnormal cells, although depending on your situation, the colposcopy might need to be repeated during your pregnancy. Your practitioner will follow up with another colposcopy about six to eight weeks after you give birth to see if the problem persists. In many cases, the abnormal changes go away on their own after delivery, making further interventions unnecessary.",HPV and have had two coloposcopies,,Female,,,,,,Does it hinder conception or does it cause early miscarriages , LEEP procedure done once,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes: Does it hinder conception or does it cause early miscarriages?

104,4106109,HIV Seroconversion?,"I had a possible exposure to HIV 11 weeks ago this thursday. I had a test at 9 weeks and 3 days which came up negative. Obviously I will be having another test at the 12 week mark but just wondered about the following.
At 8 weeks I had acute tonsilitis. If this was a sign of HIV infection and seroconversion would this mean that my body would be making antibodies and that the test at 9.5 weeks should have picked it up. In other words can i assume that the tonsilitis was just that and not in fact a symptom of HIV infection.
I have read that normally signs of infection appear within 5 weeks of contact. is this true? 
Also does anyone know the percentage of those who show negative at 9.5 weeks but positive at 12? 
Am worrying myself stupid here so would be grateful for anyone who can put my mind at rest.

Many thanks","Ok, relax.  I'm going to lay it out for you.  If you had a test at 9 weeks, then I'm fairly confident you are negative.

The average time it takes for someone to develop detectable antibodies on an HIV Elisa test is 25 days.  94% of people have detectable antibodies after 56 days of infection.  97% of people have detectable antibodies after 90 days of infection.  The remaining 3% can take up to six months mainly because they have an immune system disorder (leukemia, etc.).

I volunteer at an HIV testing clinic.  I will tell you that everyone I have seen was detectable anywhere from 2 weeks to 8 weeks post exposure.  Make sure you are tested via a blood sample rather than oral specimen.  The blood test is slightly more accurate.  

You cannot diagnose HIV based on symptoms alone...you will drive yourself crazy.  A test at 9 weeks is a HUGE indicator that you are almost certainly negative.

Sounds like you probably have tonsillitis.  Get some antibiotics and you should be fine.

This is a valuable lesson for you.  Be careful and always use protection.",HIV Seroconversion,,,,,,,,Am worrying myself stupid here,HIV,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes: Also does anyone know the percentage of those who show negative at 9.5 weeks but positive at 12?,"Yes: Am worrying myself stupid here so would be grateful for anyone who can put my mind at rest.

All the blood tests are coming back normal as well as the MRI.

He's starting to lose his balance when he stands/walks and can't sit down for any amount of time without pain from the hips down to the ankles (including the muscles).  The only comfortable position he can be in with the least amount of pain is flat on the floor - even sleeping on an extremely comfortable mattress hurts.  Regardless of where he sleeps at night, he is woken up in the middle of the night with pain.  He is taking naprosyn per the UCLA doctor until he can get in to see her.  Has anyone else experienced this or know anything about this?  He was negative for lupus, mono, lyme disease, ankylosing spondylitis.","Is it possible he's suffering from a form of dysplasia or fibromyalgia?

could be an arrhythmia, triggered by the vagus which is highly active during feeding.

could be on-going heart attack, how sure is everyone that the blockage was opened, and is still open?

could be aortic disease that was worsened by the angioplasty (the ballon goes from leg through the aorta, to the heart).  The abdominal aorta supplies blood to the gut, and if this blood is blocked, people get very anxious eating, get food fear, weight loss....

126,3168531,does my 2 year old have diabetes?,"Hi my daughter is 2 1/2 years old, recently she has been drinking excessively and constantly waking up soaking wet several times in the night.
I am frequently changing her nappy when we are out and when we are at home i am emptying her potty every 10 minutes this has only recently occured and even during the height of the summer when she would be expected to drink more her fluid intake was the same as normal.
basically what im asking is does any one out there have diabetic children and do they think this is linked i read that blurred vision is another symptom and she has just got her first pair of glasses.
If some one could give me some advice before i take her to the doctors i would be very grateful.
thanks","There are two types of diabetes.  The first, Type I, used to be refered to as juvenile diabetes because it was detected in childhood.  It is caused when the cells in the Isle of Langerhans in the spleen quit producing insulin or die.  It requires injections of insulin to treat.
  The other, Type II, is usually associated with late adulthood.  The person still produces insulin, usually in normal amounts, but due to a metabolic/edocrine malfunction, the body is unable to use the insulin as efficiently as it should.  A variation of this type is known as Gestational Diabetes, and develops only during pregnancy and disappears with delivery.  It is an indicator of risk to develop Type II later in life, but not a guarentee.
  It is rare to diagnose Type II diabetes in a child so young, but not so rare to diagnose Type !.  Although she does seem to urinate and drink a great deal, that in itself can have plenty of other explainations.   Juvenile diabetes is not a condition that develops slowly, and there is most usually a crisis point when the sugar levels in the blood reach dangerous levels.  That leads to a hospital/ER visit, and the diagnosis.  Your daughter is not likely truly diabetic, although there is something going on that the pediatrician needs to check out.  There are too many other potential problems to consider with the limited amount of information that you could disclose on the web, and of course testing ability is nil.
  The vision difficulties could be related, or could be simply due to genetics.  The doctor, unfortunately is the only one who can do that sort of determination.  Small children represent a practice of medicine completely different from that of adults, or even older children.  The rules that apply to the rest of us simply don't apply to small ones as young as your daughter.
  The doctor should be able to eliminate your diabetes concerns quite easily with a blood sugar test, and possibly a glucose tolerance test.  That is a bit difficult to do with one so small, as the glucose solution invariably makes them ill.  But that would be the logical first step.  I imagine the first test he will do is the simple blood sugar test, and a urine test to detect sugar in the urine.   From there it is hard to say what he/she will look into, as that would depend on his exam and her medical history- and the family history as well.
  I really don't think you have to be concerned about the juvenile diabetes.  While it is not unknown in one so young, that is usually associated with a very strong family history of the disorder.  It is also associated with viral infections, usually a very severe infection accompanied by high fever.   Most juvenile diabetics are closer to 9 or 10 at onset.  It also doesn't tend to develop over months, but rather days.
  As one mother to another, I wish I could tell you there was nothing to be concerned about, but truthfully I can't even completely eliminate the possibility that you are correct.  I can tell you that the likelyhood is low, and that the problems you are having are from some other cause.  Hopefully it will be something simple and easily treated, or even something she will outgrow.  The vision problems could certainly be simply little growing eyes, and also correct themselves with age.   In the meantime, gather as much of your family medical history as you can.  Find out what sort of medical problems there have been, and look at what ages any of them first needed glasses.  If you or several members of your family needed glasses as children, that could be your answer for that.  I wish you good news from the doctor, and hope your little girl has a simple to fix ailment.",drinking excessively and constantly waking up soaking wet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, basically what im asking is does any one out there have diabetic children and do they think this is linked i read that blurred vision is another symptom and she has just got her first pair of glasses.~~~,diabetic,,,,,,,"Yes: If some one could give me some advice before i take her to the doctors i would be very grateful.

132,3215254,"Lazy, AntiSocial, or Depressed? Is Depression Since Childhood possible?","bckgrnd: Iï¿½ve seen many Pdocs/therapists and been diagnosed respectively w: Cyclothymia w/ panic disorder; severe depression w/ OCD; and Bipolar w/ OCD tendencies  

So, u know the questionnaires given during the 1st visit? Well, Iï¿½ve always had a hard time answering the questions involving loss of energy, loss of interest, ect,  bcause I have always had few/too many interests; have a difficult time making friends, or keeping them once I made them; turn down others invitations to events bcause I donï¿½t have energy to do them- even as a kid I hated spending time after school doing things bcause I much rather be at home or didnï¿½t want to be away from home so long.  

Once a therapist suggested Iï¿½d been depressed since childhood, but I quickly dismissed her. But recently Iï¿½ve been thinking she was right. So I guess my ? is: do u think Iï¿½m just lazy by nature, anti-social by nature, or was that therapist on to something and do u think itï¿½s possible Iï¿½ve had depression since childhood?","If a therapist doesn't find a label for you, they can't continue to treat you, or get paid. Although I often work closely with them, I also sometimes wonder why they constantly feel the need to ALWAYS find a diagnosis, instead of just saying, ""This person has a different personality than most other people. Nothing wrong with them. Just not the norm."" So you're not the social butterfly. Some people prefer and enjoy spending their time fishing on a stream by them selves, instead of bumping shoulders at a party. Some people prefer having one GOOD friend, instead of a Roladex full of pals.  Does that make them antisocial?

Maybe you noticed these things since childhood because they are your personality, not because something's been 'wrong' with you since you were a child?

I think you're asking an excellent question. Unfortunately, in these times of 'everyone's got some psychological problem that needs treatment' you'll probably be hardpressed to find anyone willing to say it's just the way you are. 

A better question may be, are YOU, or can you be, happy with your life? Do you have activities that you enjoy, even if they're things you do alone? Are you depressed because you feel unhappy with your life, or are you unhappy because you feel you need to be 'like everyone else'? Sometimes I wonder that so many people are labeled depressed, etc., because NO ONE fits the current model of the norm. Of course, no one gets rich, if they just tell people that, tell them to enjoy being different, don't prescribe them drugs, and tell them they need to learn to love them selves as they are because they don't need any more visits.",Depression,,,,"Well, Iï¿½ve always had a hard time answering the questions involving loss of energy, loss of interest, ect,  bcause I have always had few/too many interests; have a difficult time making friends, or keeping them once I made them; turn down others invitations to events bcause I donï¿½t have energy to do them ",Depression,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Once a therapist suggested Iï¿½d been depressed since childhood, but I quickly dismissed her.",Depression,,,"Yes: do u think Iï¿½m just lazy by nature, anti-social by nature, or was that therapist on to something ","Yes: Well, Iï¿½ve always had a hard time answering the questions involving loss of energy, loss of interest, ect,  bcause I have always had few/too many interests; have a difficult time making friends, or keeping them once I made them; turn down others invitations to events bcause I donï¿½t have energy to do them- even as a kid I hated spending time after school doing things bcause I much rather be at home or didnï¿½t want to be away from home so long.

I have also had anorexia nervosa, so it is not surprising that I have another eating disorder. What is causing all of this? How can I get my life back in the balance?

Thank you for the responses. It may mean more than you'll ever know.","you may have the disorder called binge eating. when you eat that many calories in such a short amount of time you probably feel like you have no control over it. this feeling leads you to eat more and feel guilty afterwards. this can lead to bulimia if not fixed fast! what makes you feel like you have to eat is the anticiaption of the food and it makes you not care about what you will feel like after eating too much.  most of the food you eat is probably junk food and this is because you may have felt deprived earlier. it is a vicious cycle. if you find yourself eating alone in private this is a sign that you may be embarassed about it and that you may be eating for emotional problems. i am actually goin thru something similar but i told myself im goin to end it tonight. think to yourself that you are not a prisoner of food. You are in charge of your actions and what you eat. The food will always be there you can choose to eat it or not. Also wen you feel like binging stop yourself before hand. and think am i really hungry or not? if not what do i really want? and wen you are reaching for the food stop for a second and ask if that food will make you feel satisfied and happy afterward...most likely it will make you feel depressed and guilty. understand that food cannot fill an emotional void. eating more of it will only make things worse. when you feel like stuffing your mouth sit down take a few snacks out lay them on the table. ask yourself all these questions. and if you still want to eat, eat very very SLOWLY. soon you might realize that the food will not satisfy you. Then after the first few bites you wont crave it. Eat  balanced heatlhy  meals so you wont feel deprived. The main reasons for binging is low self esteem. you put too much value on weight and appearance. Know that beauty is in the eye of the beholder and your beauty is only true when you accept it. Learn to appreciate your body and all the wonderful things it does.

Love is omnipresence, Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.

A 1 week old baby will make you feel like you do nothing but nurse.  That is how you bring in your supply.  At this point, you should be nursing AT LEAST every 2 hours.  Nursing more is good.  Follow your baby's lead.  Know that breastmilk digests in about 90 mins and that your baby's tummy is about the size of her fist.

I wouldn't worry about a supply problem at this point.  Honestly, you don't have one.  :-)  What you're experiencing is normal.  Just nurse, nurse, nurse and nurse some more.  That is the best way to boost supply and it is what you and your baby need to do right now.

148,131467,Please help me choose what to do?,Ok i have posted on here before about my breasts growing larger.  I went to the doc today and found out that it is not cancer.  The doc suggested breast reduction surgery.  In a way i want to do this but in a way i dont.  I had to have a hysterectomy at a very young age and to me i lost part of my woman hood and now if i remove part of my breasts that is taking away another part of my womanhood.  What would you do in this situation? Yes i have back problems and other issues such as fibrocystic breast disease and the doc seems to think that the reduction would help.  My husband is very supporting of me with whatever i choose.  He sees the pros and the cons with both along with me.  I just feel like Ivealready lost so much.  Can someone plz give me there ideas.  Serious answers are appreciated.  Ive always been told that God will not give you any more than you can handle but I am sitting here wondering why i am being tested so much.  I seriously dont know how much more i can do to cope.,"I would recommend talking to a therapist about your feelings of loss. It sounds like a breast reduction could benefit your health and quality of life. However, you should not go ahead with the surgery until you have come to terms with your hysterectomy. I know some people may respond that you will still have your breasts but it is all about your perception. You may also want to ask around about support groups for young women that have had hysterectomies. I would try the local hospitals and your doctors. You are lucky to have a supportive husband.

149,1921805,Borderline Personality Disorder Question?,"I suspect my partner has borderline personality disorder. He's finally agreed to see a professional about it so I want to make sure it's the right person.
Should he see a psychiatrist, psychologist or a counsellor? In my understanding, a psychiatrist can diagnose, use therapy and prescribe medication, whilst a psychologist can't prescribe medication.
The literature I've read about BPD indicates that medication is not always beneficial, that various forms of long term therapy in which the BP's relearn coping mechanisms and appropriate emotional responses is more appropriate.
Therefore, would a psychologist be sufficient? Money is an issue as he has recently lost his job again and I understand a psychiatrist is very expensive.
I have read other peoples questions and answers related to this. There seems to be a popular idea that we all have problems at times and that these people are often misdiagnosed. I am studying psychology(I've only just started) and I know this is real.
Advice?","This is a great question (or series of questions); and I think it's great that you are getting involved in improving your partners well being.  I've been diagnosed Bipolar/BPD and am under intensive psychotherapy and med management therapy as well.

BPD is a very complex and serious mental illness characterized by pervasive instability in mood, interpersonal relationships, self-image, identity, and behavior. This instability often disrupts family and work life, long-term planning, and the individual's sense of self.

I think you're on to something and reaching out at these boards is great.  However, we are all pop psychiatrists and none of us can diagnose your partner, so it's imperative that you pony up and have him see the doc ASAP and get a diagnosis so you can begin proper treatment. 

I understand the issue of funds, which was a similar issue I faced at the outset of my treatment.  It's often difficult for some poeple to rationalize the importance of mental health vs. physical health.  For example, if you found out your partner needed a certain surgical procedure, per the Dr's recommendation, where if delayed, came with fatal results, would you factor in the financial roadblocks?

As far as medication vs. non-medication approach.  Med Management should be at the forefront of the treatment for BPD where psychotherapy will exist as an adjunct treatment.  What's important to understand is that BPD is often co-morbid, where it will exist with another disorder; e.g. bipolar, ADD, unipolar depression, etc.  Understanding the patient is struggling in dealing with unstable moods, thoughts and emotions, your Dr. will be able to prescribe meds to bring your partner to a more stable mindset so they can go to the next phase of treatment an begin psychotherapy.  Specifically, mood stabilizers are extremely effective and will do wonders for your partner, relatively quickly.  

Through my experience, I tend to feel like I'm fighting in a war, battling in the trenches, where depression is my enemy, medication is my armour and weaponry and my psychologists are my commanding officers, providing strategy and tactics in guiding me through the field of battle.  All of those tools combined will help defeat the enemy and guide you to safety.

I've tried meds without therapy and vice versa;  I couldn't do it.  It's very difficult at first to put yourself through Psychotherapy, but over time, you'll find that it will build strength and a better sense of self if you put in the effort.

As for the meds, I saw a psychiatrist regularly at first after going through a combination of different meds/doses.  Over time, I've found the right med/dose and acheived stabliization in my moods,thoughts and actions, which has done wonders in my life both personally and professionally.

As for the psycotherapy; I attend regular CBT (cognitive behavior therapy) weekly and group therapy twice a week and attend other support groups as needed.  The combination of which have helped initiate motivation and change in combating my illness.  When someone lives with such an illness for a long period of time, they develop learned behaviors which are incredibly difficult to change.  The psychotherapy will give you the motivation to make yourself better and the ability to change certain problematic behaviors; which is a monumental task in itself, but it is certainly acheivable.

So, better consult both types of specialists (psychiatrist and psychologist). They are better placed to say specifically how much is to be treated by medicines and how much by counseling and such methods.

In general, the term ""hammer toe"" describes a buckling of any of the toe joints. Joints at the end or middle of the toe, as well as the joint near the ball of the foot, may be affected. Toe joints usually curl because of a muscle imbalance or tight tendons. Hammer toes vary in severity and in the number of joints and toes involved.

Types of Hammer Toes
Hammer toes may be flexible or rigid, depending on the joint's ability to move. A flexible joint may become more rigid as you age.The doctor will examine all your toes, testing whether or not buckled joints can be moved. Your feet will also be checked for any skin changes. Corns (a buildup of dead skin cells) often form between curled toes or on top of buckled joints where shoes rub. If irritated, corns may turn into open wounds and become infected.If your symptoms are mild, changing shoes may be all the treatment you need. If your symptoms are severe, surgery may be needed. The type of procedure often depends on whether your toe joints are flexible or rigid.

Unfortunately, from what I read, it sounds like the only treatment is surgery (since you said it wasn't her shoes).

6,3371147,How can I help my boyfriend lose weight?,"My boyfriend is 5'10 and very near 300 lbs. We were recently told that he has signs of diabetes, he always has heartburn, very low self-esteem, but he is the sweetest man you will ever meet. The thing is that it's very hard to get him movtivated not the first week or the second but as time goes by he loses interest in trying to change his eating habits, he feels that everything is against him. He works outside from 6am - 7pm, there is no way to prepare his foods at lunch or eat in between due to his job so he usually takes just a sandwich & chips for lunch, by the time he gets home he's starved and I feel it's hard to control portions. The only exercise we can do together is walk, but it doesn't seem to be enough. In high school he tore his ACL, broke his wrist and fractured his ankles. The local pool is closed on the weekends which is the only time he has off and seemed to be my last option. I love him so much and I know he really wants to change but what other options are there?","I once dated a very obese man, and wondered this myself.  In the end, I realized that he did not want to change.  There was nothing I could do for him, he had to want to do it himself.  We ended up breaking up, because he refused to do anything to change his unhealthy habits and that is not how I wished to live my life.  Hopefully, your boyfriend really wants to change his lifestyle not just to please you, but for his own health and well being.  In the end, if he doesn't really want to do it for himself, then nothing you do will help him.

That being said, there are some things you can do.  Number one, of course, is to be very supportive of him.  He will have bad days now and then, and you both have to work through it.

The best place to start is to look at his current routine and pick a few small changes at a time so the change is not too drastic.  This is not a temporary diet, but a lifestyle he should be able to really live with in the long run.

Does he eat breakfast?  Studies have shown that people who eat breakfast are able to lose weight and keep it off.  I recommend a low calorie/high fiber/high protein/low sugar cereal with skim milk.  I like cinnamon shredded wheat or quaker oatmeal squares.  Also include some fruit, like a banana.

For lunch, he currently eats a sandwich and chips?  Does he bring it or buy it from a place like Togos or Subway?  Either way, can he switch to wheat bread instead of white?  Switching to low fat mayo or using mustard instead will save a lot of calories.  Also, skip the cheese.  Turkey is a good lean source of protein, but lean ham or roast beef isn't all that bad.  Just stay away from meatballs or balogna or other fatty deli meats.  Also, put more veggies on it, like lettuce, tomato, and other things.  Instead of chips, could he have an apple or something like that?  At least choose a lower fat variety of chips, such as sunchips or those Baked potato chips.

If he is starved when he gets home, then I'd say he needs to have a snack in the afternoon.  Ideally, something with protein.  Maybe he could bring a protein bar to work?  There are a bunch of good ones out there by South Beach Diet, SlimFast, and Special K has a new protein bar as well.

For dinner, try fixing some grilled chicken, veggies, and brown rice or something similar.  It needs to contain lean protein, some kind of veggies (ask him which are his favorites so he'll actually eat them), and a complex carbohydrate with lots of fiber.  Also, drinking water instead of soda will make a HUGE difference.

As for the walking, I would say that's an excellent start.  It's something you can do together and get into the habit of daily exercise.  If he has injuries, it might not be a good idea to push him too much too soon.  Maybe try to increase the speed or duration of the walks a little every week.  You might try signing up to walk a 5K race in the spring, so he has a goal in mind to work towards.  Consult a doctor before you do anything too strenuous though.",lose weight,,,,"The thing is that it's very hard to get him movtivated not the first week or the second but as time goes by he loses interest in trying to change his eating habits, he feels that everything is against him.",boyfriend lose weight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,what other options are there?,"The thing is that it's very hard to get him movtivated not the first week or the second but as time goes by he loses interest in trying to change his eating habits, he feels that everything is against him.",,,,,"Yes: Hopefully, your boyfriend really wants to change his lifestyle not just to please you, but for his own health and well being.

The results from the x-ray and cat-scan said i had a generous amount of stool in my colon. I had a colonosopy las t year to emove 3 pile-ups. What do i do now? Nothing works!","First the important thing is to talk to your doctor.

Next, don't take laxatives because your intestines (smooth involuntary muscle) will learn to rely on them.

It is important to increase your fiber intake - soluble and insoluble.  Soluble fiber (like the white/yellow part of an apple) makes your stool soft, and insoluble fiber (the apple peel) irritates the intestines and stimulates movement (peristalsis).

There are fiber supplements - if you intend to use those be certain to take enough water, otherwise that too can contribute to an obstruction.  There are bran cereals that are easy to eat - for example all bran has half a day's fiber in 1/3 cup of cereal.  Sprinkle that on a salad instead of bacon bits, mix it into muffins for extra fiber...etc.  Increase your intake of vegetables too.

You could end up with a nasty bout of diverticulosis which may also land you in surgery, and you only have so much bowel that can be removed.  You could also end up with a colostomy bag.

10,3897103,Do diseases vary among race?,I've heard that Lupus is primarily a disease among asians and native Americans. My grandmother is half Cherokee Indian. My mother died 3 years ago from the complications of lupus and the drugs she was taking. I've also heard that African Americans are more likely to get menningitis than others. Sickle cell anemia seems to be another disease among blacks. Is this accurate? And if it is: what genetic factors are involved with this?,"The frequency of diseases do vary by race to some degree. The most common reason is genetic or cultural or unknown.  For instance diabetes is very common in the Indian populations in Upstate New York because of the many years of inbreeding in the small population. Glucose levels can be on the average twice as high than the normal white population.  There are cultural traditions in some sub-populations that cause diseases - one which was common on Islands in the pacific was some thing called Laughing Disease - It was caused by eating the brain of the tribal member you just killed.  The brain carried a virus that infected the brain of the guy who is eating the brain.  Ugh

A recently medical study out of John Hopkins which compared more than 15,000 patients comparing disease out comes found that there were still poorer results for certain races when compared to the average population and they could not uncover the cause because all  of the studied population receive identical treatment. They assumed that there was some cause for the statical variation but they made no clinical conclusion other than it was unknown at this time.  

Lupus is found in all populations to some degree and I have never heard that it is more common in Asians and native Americans. As far as meningitis in Africans - I have not found any study that confirms it is more common.  You are correct that sickle cell anemia is much more common in blacks than other populations and that is a genetic issue. 

If you are Eastern European or Italian and have the gene called HLA- B27 - you will have the potential for more intestinal diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, diverticulitis, and other diseases related to that gene. Having gene does not mean you will get the diseases it means you will have a great probability to come down with these diseases.",Do diseases vary among race,,,,My mother died 3 years ago from the complications of lupus and the drugs she was taking.,mother died,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Do diseases vary among race?,,,,,,Not applicable,,,
13,2825139,Sinus Headaches & Root Canals?,"I have several questions.  First of all, I have really, really bad sinus'; everyone in my family does.  So, lately ( the past week or so ), I have been getting really bad sinus headaches.  I have recently had some dental work done ( 2 root canals and a temporary filling ) and I have noticed that whenever I get those really bad sinus headaches, it makes the whole left side ( the same side that I recently had a root canal and a temporary filling done ) of my face and jaw hurt; it doesn't necessarily make the tooth that had the root canal hurt or the tooth that was filled.  But definitely my face and jaw so it sometimes feels as if those two teeth are hurting...does that make sense?
 
Secondly, at my last dentist visit ( about a month and a half ago ), I had a root canal done and on another tooth, I had a cavity; not a deep cavity but a cavity.  So, after my dentist did the root canal, he put some medicine in the other tooth and sealed it up.  He said he wanted to watch that tooth to see if that one would have to have a root canal also.  My question is...how can you tell if it needs to have a root canal or not? It doesn't seem swollen or sensitive or anything like that...like I have been brushing it for awhile now and it doesn't hurt or anything like that.  How long after he put the medicine in can you tell if it should have a root canal or not?  What are the symptoms? 
 
Lastly and this is kind of embarrassing but...ever since I have begun dental work ( after 10 years or so of not going to the dentist ), I have noticed that I have begun to drool more than usual.  Now, I used to drool...does that have anything to do with it?  Does the recent dental work have anything to do with it? 
 
Thanks in advance!!","well  firstly coming to ur sinusitis problem : 

             as u have mentioned that sinusitis happens to b present among all ur family members , that might b the major cause for u  r sinusitis or any infections in ur nasal mucous membrane .

secondly coming to the relationship between sinusitis and ur root canal treated teeth , it's no ways linked in ur case , b'coz sinusitis as a result of dental origin occurs because if any infections or injudicious instrumentationperforating the sinus occuring or  carried out in the upper jaw and remember in ur case both r.c treated teeth are present in the  the right sided lower jaw and is simply impossible to have sinusitis because r,c treated lower teeth. 
 
more over ur sinusitis occurs on the left side , and ur jaw pains on left side and is simply b'coz u over load ur left side of ur jaw 


and lastly temporarily filled teeth , th infection may b very close to th pulp of teeth , in such instances we put calcium hydroxide dressing in the teeth allowing to form calcified tissue shielding the pulp from infection , if it happens there is no need for r.c.t , if calcifeid tissue fails to form after placement of medication and infection has reached the pulp then we do r.c.t

  symptoms of a patient to go for  r.c.t 

 severe sharp which gets excruciated up on taking cold and hot beverages , severe nocturnal pain , postural pain , th epain doesn't get relieved on medication and persists for longer time.

 there is no relation beween drooling of saliva and dental treatment , excessive drooling of saliva is a symptom of oral submucous fibrosis , facial palsy and rabies, nothing to get worried in ur case 

any more doubts ................ feel free

please could someone help me on this 

serious answers only","Hi, if you feel you need a second opinion, then seek it. Did you know that antibiotics will run the natural immune system down if on them too long, I mean course after course after course. The body needs to fight certain infections for itself to be able to build a strong immune system.
A young child can be prone to chest infections if drinking lots of milk, cut back a little and give lots of fluids to help flush any infection through the body. You can get infant vitamin tablets maybe you should consider this and keep to recommended daily dosage as overdosing on vitamins can cause serious side effects.
Be sure to give your child a healthy balanced diet and not just junk. Lots of carrots and veggies and fruit. 
Don't give them too many bananas as they cause constipation in the very young. 
He does sound exceedingly tired but his weight loss could be growing into a boy from a baby, there is a hell of a change in the body form. I know as my son did the same as his baby legs become ladder legs....very tall and the taller they are going to be be the more likely they will suffer with growing pains.
Lots to consider before making a self diagnosis of Leukemia.
A growing child can have growing pains, a growing child can also be prone to ailments but their diet will help to make a difference as well as a good bedtime routine.
If your concerns or your childs health doesn't improve then DO get the second opinion. Better to be safe than sorry, but don't panic and think the worst, look at it from all angles especially the normality of a childs growth patterns. I have had seven to learn by and each are different but there was a pattern in the growing pains for the tall and at certain ages. Body changes as they grow which can be quite frightning for a parent who isn't aware of how fast they can change, height weight etc. Sometimes you see the weight loss but miss how tall they have become, understand?

Good luck, and I pray your child will get healthy soon.

I really need some answers...it just doesn't make sense.","Chlorinated hydrocarbons (CHCs) are ubiquitous persistent substances that are incorporated into the body via ingestion, inhalation, and transcutaneously. Cell and animal studies have shown that CHCs are stored in different organs, especially the fatty tissue; exhibit hormonelike activity; and induce immunological changes (1-5). Miscarriages, fetal malformations, and growth retardation were observed in women with occupational exposure to chlorinated hydrocarbons or accidental CHC poisoning (6-10). 
In women with repeated miscarriages, intensive diagnostics allow the identification of a definite cause in some cases only, such as, for example, chromosomal, uterine, or hormonal disorders. In the majority of miscarriages, however, the cause remains unknown, so that discrete hormonal or immunological disorders are assumed. Therefore, further factors must be identified that may affect female fertility and play an etiological role in the pathogenesis of repeated miscarriages. In a previous cross-sectional study of an unselected group of 322 infertile women, increasing blood dichlorodiphenyldichloroethene (DDE) levels were significantly associated with a decreasing conception rate and increasing pentachlorophenol (PCP) concentrations with an increasing miscarriage rate (11). 

We conducted this observational study to detect a possible etiological role of chlorinated hydrocarbons in the pathogenesis of repeated miscarriages. CHC levels of women with repeated miscarriages were compared with those of a reference population. Furthermore, women with primary versus secondary miscarriages, women with early versus late miscarriages, and women with hormonal or immunological disorders as causes of repeated miscarriages versus women with idiopathic repeated miscarriages were investigated in order to detect possible differences between these different types of repeated miscarriages. The working hypothesis was that an increased body burden of CHC may be an important etiological factor in repeated miscarriages. We therefore expected to detect increased CHC levels in women with repeated miscarriages in comparison to the reference population. We also investigated possible effects of low-level CHC exposure on hormonal and immunological parameters, which may also play an etiological role in repeated miscarriages. The long-term effects of CHC levels with respect to further conceptions and the outcome of pregnancies were also observed. We must stress, however, that this is an observational study conducted to detect possible associations and to create new working hypotheses for controlled studies. 


Material and Methods
Subjects. We determined CHC levels in addition to the usual diognostics in 89 women with a history of at least two miscarriages who attended the Clinic of Reproductive Endocrinology between 1989 and 1993. Miscarriages in women who had never delivered a baby are defined as primary miscarriages (n = 65). A history of miscarriages following the delivery of at least one baby with the same partner defines secondary miscarriages (n = 24). Sixty women complained of early miscarriages (by the 12th week of gestation), and 5 women complained of late miscarriages (13th-25th week of gestation). Twenty-four women had a history of both types. Thirty-nine percent of the women had a history of 2 miscarriages, 31% of 3, and 30% of 4 or more miscarriages, with a maximum 12 miscarriages. The median age of the women was 28 years (range 21-39 years), the median body mass index (BMI = body weight/height2) was 22 kg/m2 (range 17-37 kg/m2). Of these women, 87% were German. Non-Germans were mainly women from Eastern and Central Europe. All of them were Caucasian. Seventy-two percent of the women were employed, 15% were housewives, and 13% were industrial workers. Seventy percent of the women were nonsmokers, 18% smoked 1-10 cigarettes/day, 8% smoked 11-20 cigarettes/day, and 4% smoked more than 20 cigarettes/day.

47,1510808,Can eating healthy or drinking energy drinks reduce ADD/ADHD symptoms?,"Or having a good night's sleep?

From my own observations, it seems that I tend to be more focused and pay attention better after eating or doing certain things.
When I don't have a good night sleep I have difficulty hearing what people are saying, it's like my mind blocks them out intentionally for some reason.
If I don't eat right, I become self-absorbed and become less alert to the environment around me (bad for driving!).
If I don't drink an energy drink on a work day I am more prone to passive-aggression and holding grudges against others, and fail to be more openminded and see things from other peoples' point of view. I also have a harder time pleasing customers when I don't have an energy drink to give me the boost.

But is there any scientific reason why this is? Am I just off on everything?",I think eating less sugar and less artificial coloring and flavoring can reduce the problems associated with this disorder.

My daughter was dx'd with ADD/ADHD/PDD-NOS and then High-functioning Autism by her ped and later by state funded physical and occupational therapists through early intervention. She was medicated at the school's insistence for ADHD. When that made things worse instead of better, we had her evaluated at our local pediatric rehabilitation center and learned that she was actually a perfect match for the symptoms/actions of Aspergers Syndrome and early onset bi-polar disorder. The reason the meds made things worse was that with bi-polar, you can't give just the anti-depressant, you have to do a mood stabilizer as well, or the manic symptoms will intensify and often times go out of control.

54,235318,Can you experience symptoms from the morning after pill a week later?,"I took the morning after pill last Monday (11/6) which was 2 days after the last day of my period (which started Monday Oct, 30).  A week later (today and last night) I'm experiencing spotting, bloating, nausea, and a little cramping.

57,311853,I'm just 16 and i have Graves disease. Is there anyone in the same condition like me? What about my future?,"I've been having treatment since Dec 2005 and right now i'm like in the hyper phase. I'm fully aware about all the medication&treatment stuff and the alternatives. But i have no idea if this disease is cured, will there be any hard conditions in future when i wanna have baby etc? also my doctor says that it is not common to have Graves in my age. is there anyone in the same situation and wanna give me soeme advice? what does your m.d. tell?i'm just too curious..","Hi!  Onset of my Grave's began at 15 but was asymptomatic (to the doctors) until age 22, when I demanded a blood test (I thought I was dying).  You see, I weighed 85 lbs. on my high school graduation day and looked anorexic.  Grave's had developed when I first menstruated, so I never had a steady period.  That, my weight, and my althleticism led the docs to think I was just slow to develop or too athletic for regular menstruation.  

Anyway, upon a blood tests they found massive Grave's, gave me the meds, and all went well.  I went into remission about 1 year after the diagnosis at age 23.  I grew an inch taller and developed breasts (what a wonderful concept) that year as well.  I finally developed fat cells, long awaited, at age 25 and looked a healthy weight from then onward.

Yes, you can have children, but please wait until you are in remission from the Grave's.  You really don't want to be playing with Grave's when you are pregnany, since that's an additional factor which must be considered.

My advice is be patient with the whole process.  They have to first determine the best treatments ... I say treatments because for me it was PTU, which turned out not to work, to tapazol, which did work.  Had that not worked, we would have got to the subpartial thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine procedure.  You'll have monthly blood tests, enough to know your phlebotomist by name each time.  

No, it's not common to develop Grave's at your age.  I'd never met anyone (until I just talked to you) who had developed it like me.  BUT ... I have to tell you, be very thankful it has been found!  I went through 7 years of thinking I was going crazy, stupid doctor-prescribed weight gain diets, being forbidden from any exercise whatsoever (I'd lose too much weight), and unexplained emergency room visits for malnutrition (and I ate like a horse).  So, knowing what it is is half the battle.  Now you just have to figure out how you'll manage the next year being patient.  You will get better ... you're not ""cured"" but you can go into remission.  

I went into remission at age 23, had monthly blood tests for a while (still in remission), then graduated to six months (still in remission) then went to yearly (still in remission).  About 8 years later, my doctor didn't want to do the blood test, since he said I was fine.  I insisted, since I have an abiding fear of Grave's, and it's a good thing I did. I now have Hashimoto's, the exact opposite of Grave's.  I am hypo and take replacement thyroid hormone.

According to the research I did on Grave's, the docs aren't sure where the Grave's antibody comes from, but it looks like thyroid disorders can run in families, which was my case (I have 4 maternal aunts and my mother with thyroid issues).  Further, there is some indication that the thyroid comes with a shelf life, which is what I think is occuring with me.  With the way it went unchecked for so long (I was almost in thyroid storm, my numbers were so high -- the doc didn't know how I was alive), my thyroid really went into overdrive.  What if it can operate that way for only so long?  Anyway, that's the premise I operate on today, that the Grave's is gone forever and Hashimoto's is here to stay. My endocrinologist told me not to make such absolute statements, but I think the thyroid I have is dying slowly ... I'd much rather this than Grave's since Grave's is so insidious with me.

Anyhow, I am now 38 and that's my story.  I hope it makes you feel a bit better that it can happen to teens.  You also need to be vigilant from now on, telling docs you need that blood test just to be safe, etc.  You WILL go into remission, one way or the other, and there are no real bad effects later on from this, as long as you keep on top of it.  You'll want to continue drinking milk and exercising, since the latest studie",Graves disease,,,,,,,,"But i have no idea if this disease is cured, will there be any hard conditions in future when i wanna have baby etc?",Graves disease,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,will there be any hard conditions in future when i wanna have baby etc?,,,,is there anyone in the same situation and wanna give me soeme advice?,,"Yes: Anyhow, I am now 38 and that's my story.

69,1065636,Has anyone ever been diagnosed with Compartment Syndrome?,"I am a runner who has been diagnosed with bilateral compartment syndrome in my lower legs.  I am currently seeing a specialist, as well as recieving therapy a few times a week.  The thing is, I am finding that the stretching and exercises that I have been shown to do feel like they are worsening my injury rather then improving it. Has anyone else ever worked through this injury, and if so, do you have any tips on how to decrease the pain associated with working out/ training/ living!?","did your doctors explain to you what the pain was being caused by? It is generally due to an increase in pressure within the compartment of muscles on the anterior aspect of the lower leg. There is not a lot of give in the sheaths holding the muscles together so an exercise level you are not used to, or even a new exercise may cause swelling in the anterior muscles, increasing the pressure.

In some extreme cases, surgery is required to remove the pressure as blood vessels and nerves to the area can become damaged, a side effect of which is necrotic tissue (tissue that has died due to a lack of oxygen). Your doctors should have already addressed this with you, but if not and your pain continues, bring it up with them. As if the inflammation continues, you could get septicemia which is deadly.

You could try an ice pack after doing your stretches to decrease the swelling, or elevating your legs above heart level. I would also talk to your specialist and tell them of your concerns. It may be they might have to manipulate the stretches for you, or the stretches may not be right for the current stage in recovery you are in.

During the day, anti-inflammatory drugs may also help. Check before taking these though if you are a competitive athlete as some may be on the banned list!

Keep in mind, this may all be a normal part of the healing process as you are working already inflamed muscles.!.

77,1578133,Need Help Interpreting Blood tests-Please help :0) !?,"Hi there,
I am examining my blood tests 'cause of frustration w/the VA medical care I've been getting.  Pls help me interpret these tests!!!  

-M-MONO for the 4 & 1/2 Yrs has come up positive. 12.2-12.6 (tested 3X's)
-ANTI rnp has tested positive 2X's in 3 yrs.  Level @ 2.04, 2nd level can't 
 figure out.
-ANA ab: Postive 2X's.  I can't figure what the levels R on this one.

I have been having the following medical issues: 

Migraines, menorrhagia, SEVERE, constant fatigue, tachycardia, periods of bracycardia, weight gain, rare spells of complete weakness (My BP goes sky high, my HR goes high, and I shake badly.) I am thirsty all of the time-I probably drink over 2 gallons of water a day!, feel like I need to swallow all the time.

I've taken matters into my hands 'cause I can't live like an invalid any longer!  I have a young family & intend to take care of them 4 a while!!!

Pls help me figure out what these mean so when I go 2 the DR I can tell him wut 2 test 4!","I'm not sure what the first 2 tests are.  You'll need the full name instead of the short form for me to make any sense of it.  As well as the unit of measurement for the result.

The last test (ANA) is anti-nuclear antibody.  It is generally used to test for autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, commonly known as SLE or lupus.  A positive test is suggestive of the disease.  This disease is characterised by the butterfly rash over the face.  But as it's name suggests, it is a systemic disease affecting many organs.  Other blood tests for SLE may include anti-rho antibody, anti- dsDNA antibody (anti double stranded DNA antibody), C3 and C4 (complement 3 and complement 4) levels.  The diagnosis of SLE, however, is mainly clinical.  The American Rheumatology Association has a criteria for diagnosing SLE, you'll need to fulfil 4 out of the 11 criteria to be diagnosed with SLE.  Do a search on yahoo and there'll be plenty of sites with links to the criteria.

ANOTHER OPTION TO CHECKING THE ACCURACY OF YOUR MONITOR IS TO TEST IT WITH A CONTROL SOLUTION.  ASK AT THE PHARMACY IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY.  IT USUALLY COMES WITH A NEW MONITOR.

IT COULD BE THAT YOUR READINGS AT HOME ARE ELEVATED DUE TO WHAT YOU ATE.  I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT YOU ARE EATING HEALTHY, BUT IF YOU ATE SOMETHING WITH HIGH CARBS OR SUGAR, THAT COULD CAUSE THE HIGHER READING.  ALSO, STRESS IS A FACTOR.  IF YOU ARE STRESSED OUT OVER A POTENTIAL HIGH READING, THAT ALONE CAN MAKE IT READ HIGHER.  IF YOU ARE SLIGHTLY UNDER THE WEATHER, COLD LIKE SYMPTOMS, THAT TOO CAN ELEVATE THE BLOOD SUGAR.  

OCCASIONALLY, I TAKE MY MONITOR WITH ME TO THE DOCTORS.  DO A 'SIDE BY SIDE' COMPARISON TO SEE IF I GET A READING CLOSE TO THE DOCTORS OFFICE MACHINE.  ALSO, NEXT TIME YOU HAVE BLOOD DRAWN TO CHECK YOUR BLOOD SUGAR, TAKE YOUR MONITOR WITH YOU AND TEST WITH IT AT THE SAME TIME THE LAB DRAWS BLOOD.  THAT TOO WILL CHECK THE ACCURACY OF YOUR MONITOR.

Thank you very much.","Treating benign and malignant tumors and other disorders, via a process known as Focused Ultrasound Surgery (FUS) or HIFU, High Intensity Focused Ultrasound. These procedures generally use lower frequencies than medical diagnostic ultrasound (from 250 kHz to 2000 kHz), but significantly higher time-averaged intensities. The treatment is often guided by MRI, as in Magnetic Resonance guided Focused Ultrasound. 
More powerful ultrasound sources may be used to clean teeth in dental hygiene or generate local heating in biological tissue, e.g. in occupational therapy, physical therapy and cancer treatment. 
Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy uses a powerful focused ultrasound source to break up kidney stones. 
Focused ultrasound sources may be used for cataract treatment by phacoemulsification. 
Additional physiological effects of low-intensity ultrasound have recently been discovered, e.g. the ability to stimulate bone-growth and its potential to disrupt the blood-brain barrier for drug delivery. 
Ultrasound is used in UAL (= ultrasound-assisted lipectomy), or liposuction.

With my respect.","Liver disease can be a very difficult problem to deal with for people. As long as you stay in touch with his doctors and get him all the services and care he needs, you will ensure that his condition is optimized. 

Your father has Cirrhosis. This is a chronic liver diseases (usually due to Hepatitis) where the normal liver cells are damaged and replaced by scar tissue. Basically, the amount of normal liver tissue is decreased. Liver disease is common in the US (ranked 8th as a cause of death in the United States).

Your dad's Gastroenterologist would make this diagnosis and it sounds like he is getting worked up for Cirrhosis. Without knowimg more details about him it may be hard to say but it seems unlikely that he has cancer. 
Cancer of the liver is usually diagnosed by imaging, clinical picture and labwork (serum AFP). The most common (primary) malignancy of the liver is hepatocellular carcinoma. The only treatment is liver transplant. However, this surgery is very complicated. 

You can help your father by watching his SALT intake, making sure he takes his medications and that he gets to his appointments. (Develope a close relationship with his Gastroenterologist/ Hepatologist.)

The websites the first answerer gave you are good resources. You will find that rather than different stages, there are actually different types of MS.  Some come and go, some deteriorate.  Depending on the type your brother has, there are different expectations, including difficulty walking, talking, cognitive changes, etc.  Its a tough disease, especially since the patients are generally so young.  Your brother is lucky to have a sister like you who cares so much.  Staying on his meds, and staying out of the heat are two important factors.

I have had chronic urticaria as long as I can remember (I'm 20) My allergist couldn't even do an allergy test on me because just being poked, even without an allergen on the needle, caused me to break out.  I have been taking ranitidine and singulair for the past year, and it has been helping, although it has not cured it.  Try taking benedryl before you go to bed. It is a anti-histamine, which will help the hives, and it will make you sleepy also. I wouldn't recommend doing that long-term though. I only do it when I am absolutely desperate for sleep.  If you are allergic to any foods, it could just take a while for your system to react to it, so watch what you eat for dinner, or go on a elimination diet if you strongly think that food is the cause. I was told that a chemical in tomatos can make allergic reactions worse, so while they may not cause a reaction, if you have a reaction while that is in your system it could make it worse.

102,2984785,"How affective is Adderall XR, 40 mg q a.m. in divided doses?","My 8 year old daughter has been diagnosed with ADD.

How affective do you think this regimen will be on her so far as affecting her concentration?Will the breakfast she consumed 20 mins or so prior to the dosage adversely affect the Adderall dosage?  In otherwords, will it minimize its affects. I need for her to concentrate and focus.  
Thanks for all your help.","Adderall is not affected by food. The XR formula is meant for extended release. What was the doctor's rationale in offering the option of giving the 40mg in divided doses 20-30 min. apart??  I'm guessing it's to further extend the release but 30 min. isn't a significant amount of time.  Give the med with food and reduce the number of times your daughter has to take meds by dosing her once daily and at the same time each day.

104,3002034,I have been diagnosed with an arachnoid cyst on the right parieto-occipital region. Where is that exactly?,"So I had my MRI yesterday and that's what the results came back as.

So anyone who has had any experience along these lines and can help shed some light, I'd be more than appreciative!

The right parieto-occipital region of the brain is towards the back of the head, since that's where the occipital lobes are.  This cyst is also somewhat lateral--towards the side--since there is also mention of the parietal lobe, which is directly in front of the occipital lobe.

An arachnoid cyst is a cyst of the middle membrane that surrounds the brain, which is called the arachnoid. It is one of three membranes of this type. The only treatment, as you probably already know, is surgery to remove it. Anything that grows inside your head that's not supposed to be there can cause increases in the pressure inside the brain, which is absolutely detrimental, so even if it's benign--which an arachnoid cyst IS--they want to remove it ASAP.

what were the warning signs that you experienced when you were diognosed with diabetes? and how old were u? what is your life like now? 

i am just scared, i dont want to have this disease....","Hello,

First off I am not a Doctor. But I have had diabetes for over 34 years and have studied diabetes for years.

With your family history it is very possible that you too could have diabetes. The disease is heredity. There are several different types of diabetis and by what you explained in your question it sounds like you might have HYPOGLYCEMIA. This is caused by your pancreous producing too much of the hormone INSULIN. What this means is that your body is producing too much insulin and causes your sugar level to drop. This causes the symptoms you explained. In fact, I have the very same symptoms when my blood sugar is low. Without a decent sugar level (70-120) your body does not have the energy you need to move. This is usually controlled by diet, exercise, and testing your blood sugar. A glucose test will tell the Dr. if your body is producing enough insulin to handle large amounts of sugar. If your body is not handling the sugar will your results will show high blood sugar. The thyroid can also play a part in diagnosing diabetis.

Symptoms of uncontrolled diabetis include headaches, extreme tiredness, vomiting, stomach pain, excessive urination and burning when you urinate, sores that won't heal, and extreme thirst and without treatment could lead to you passing out and coma.

I was about 11 when I was diagnosed and I'm 45 now. I have lived a good life and not much stands in my way. I pretty determined. I have my ups and downs and I do have a few complications like neuropthy. I've had two children and both of them are fine. The only difference is I have to pay attention to my disease, test my sugar, eat right. Nothing more than what an extreme health nut would do to stay healthy.

Good luck and let me know if you have any questions.

These symptoms arent consisently there, maybe 1-2 times a day for an hour or so. Can a high blood pressure medication cause such or is this some unrelated condition that I should seek out?","Possible Side Effects of Drugs That Lower Blood Pressure
Some of the drugs listed below can affect certain functions of the body, resulting in bad side effects. However, drugs that lower blood pressure have proven effective over the years. The benefits of using them far outweigh the risk of side effects. Most people whoï¿½ve taken these drugs havenï¿½t had any problems.

Diuretics ï¿½ Some of these drugs may decrease your body's supply of a mineral called potassium. Symptoms such as weakness, leg cramps or being tired may result. Eating foods containing potassium may help prevent significant potassium loss. You can prevent potassium loss by taking a liquid or tablet that has potassium along with the diuretic, if your doctor recommends it. Diuretics such as amiloride (Midamar), spironolactone (Aldactone) or triamterene (Dyrenium) are called ""potassium sparing"" agents. They donï¿½t cause the body to lose potassium. They might be prescribed alone but are usually used with another diuretic. Some of these combinations are Aldactazide, Dyazide, Maxzide or Moduretic.

Some people suffer from attacks of gout after prolonged treatment with diuretics. This side effect isn't common and can be managed by other treatment.

In people with diabetes, diuretic drugs may increase the blood sugar level. A change in drug, diet, insulin or oral antidiabetic dosage corrects this in most cases. Your doctor can change your treatment. Most of the time the degree of increase in blood sugar isn't much. Impotence may also occur in a small percentage of people.

Beta-blockers ï¿½ Acebutolol (Sectral), atenolol (Tenormin), metoprolol (Lopressor), nadolol (Corgard), pindolol (Visken), propranolol (Inderal) or timolol (Blocadren) may cause insomnia, cold hands and feet, tiredness or depression, a slow heartbeat or symptoms of asthma. Impotence may occur. If you have diabetes and youï¿½re taking insulin, have your responses to therapy monitored closely.

ACE inhibitors ï¿½ These drugs, such as captopril (Capoten), enalapril (Vasotec), lisinopril (Zestril or Prinivil), may cause a skin rash; loss of taste; a chronic dry, hacking cough; and in rare instances, kidney damage.

Angiotensin II receptor blockers ï¿½ These drugs may cause occasional dizziness.

Calcium channel blockers ï¿½ Diltiazem (Cardizem), nicardipine (Cardene), Nifedipine (Procardia) and verapamil (Calan or Isoptin) may cause palpitations, swollen ankles, constipation, headache or dizziness. Side effects with each of these drugs differ a great deal.

Alpha blockers ï¿½ These drugs may cause fast heart rate, dizziness or a drop in blood pressure when you stand up.

Combined alpha and beta blockers ï¿½ People taking these drugs may experience a drop in blood pressure when they stand up.

Central agonists ï¿½ Alpha methyldopa (Aldomet) may produce a greater drop in blood pressure when you're in an upright position (standing or walking) and may make you feel weak or faint if the pressure has been lowered too far. This drug may also cause drowsiness or sluggishness, dryness of the mouth, fever or anemia. Male patients may experience impotence. If this side effect persists, your doctor may have to change the drug dosage or use another medication.

Clonidine (Catapres), guanabenz (Wytensin) or guanfacine (Tenex) may produce severe dryness of the mouth, constipation or drowsiness. If you're taking any of these drugs, donï¿½t stop suddenly, because your blood pressure may rise quickly to dangerously high levels.

Peripheral adrenergic inhibitors ï¿½ Reserpine may cause a stuffy nose, diarrhea or heartburn. These effects aren't severe and no treatment is required other than to change the amount of drugs taken. If you have nightmares or insomnia or get depressed, tell your doctor. You should stop using the drugs.

Guanadrel (Hylorel) or guanethidine (Ismelin) may cause some diarrhea, which may persist in some people.

He takes medicine for his disease.  I am currently not able to go and take care of him because I am at work, and I won't be off until really late tonight.  Is there anything I can tell him to do to make him feel better?  Are there any foods he can eat to take his sugar down?","My step brother is diabetic as was my step father - who incidently died at age 38 years old due to complications from diabetes and his kidney transplant.

I'm not saying that to scare you -I'm saying it because when your sugar level swings up and down - 480, then 40, then 320, then 85..ALL the time - this does damage to the renal veins in the eys and kidneys.

He MUST not only get his sugar down (which can ONLY be brought down by the correct amount of insulin and NOT food or water - but by insulin prescribed in dosage amounts for him and his body weight.) but he has to CONTROL it.  It can NOT swing like that! Dangerous - can cause strokes, heart attacks, internal organ damages.

The question is - what did he eat that put him over the edge? Sweets? Alcohol? just even a big sandwich? does he have the flu? Alot of things can affect sugar.

He DOES need to call his doctor immediately and schedule an evaluation of diet and medication to see what the right combination is for him.

My step bro uses the insulin pump with great sucess -he's one that never took care of his sugar either -with it swinging up and down - now with the pump he is better managing his diabetes - althoug he still doesn't follow the correct diet that he should - and I'm not saying it is easy to do that. I have 10lbs to lose and I can't even do that right - its HARD!! But..its IMPORTANT and diabetics can live very healthy energetic lives and grow to old age if they work cooperatively with their doctor.

You also - MUST check on him -if his sugar is out of whack so that he's not passing out and no one finds him alone..My stepuncles wife (my stepaunt if you will) her brothers died within 2 months of each other. 34 and 37 years old - both had unregulated diabetes. Both were home ALONE and had bad reactions - and no one knew. it was horrifically sad.

Again I'm not saying this to upset you -but its a serious disease that needs to be monitored. Call your friend and have him get someone over there to sit with him.

And lastly - please forgive me for saying this - but his diabetic problems can not be something you make yourself sick over -HE HAS TO DO IT FOR HIMSELF. And yes - as his friend you should encourage that he get the help he needs. We all suffered so much guilt when my stepfather died - but know what? I miss him, I love him, he was amazing - but he did it to himself...he started smoking after his kidney transplant again...he didn't exercise, he didn't watch his diet - and we lost him- its been 11 years and I still cry.

I have had lower back pain now for 5 yrs & I'm sick of it. The doctor can't find anything wrong, the chriopracter (SP) keeps popping it at the same spot, but says everything is fine. The x-rays show nothing. I do exercises recommended by the chrio, wear heating pads (which helps some), & take advil. I've had an upper & lower GI done (nothing wrong), it is not gas, constipation, or cramps. I feel better when I wear a corset, which makes me think it might be bad posture, but I'm not sure how to fix that (yes I have a large chest, but not so large that according to doc to harm me). I am 10 lbs over weight for my height, & eat healthy.  The pain starts when I get up for the day & only sitting hunched in a chair do I feel it lessen.  If I try sit-ups or curls I'm unable to move. No injuries, no accidents.I'm still able to work & function, but I would like to fix this.  Does anyone have any serious answers or suggestions?","WEbMD states. ""Some exercises can aggravate back pain. If you have low back pain, avoid:

Straight leg sit-ups. 
Bent leg sit-ups or partial sit-ups (curl-ups) when you have acute back pain. 
Lifting both legs while lying on your back (leg lifts). 
Lifting heavy weights above the waist (standing military press or bicep curls). 
Toe touches while standing.""  In fact, as you have found they can aggravate the pain. I have listed a few sites below with recommended exercises to help strengthen your low back muscles. Start out slow and do not push too fast. In addition, quit slumping. Poor posture does not help the problem and will cause other problems down the road. ""It's important that you don't let fear of pain keep you from trying gentle activity. You should try to be active soon after noticing pain, and gradually increase your activity level. Too little activity can lead to loss of flexibility, strength, and endurance, and then to more pain.

Exercises that may help reduce or prevent low back pain include:

Aerobic exercise, to condition your heart and other muscles, maintain health, and speed recovery. 
Strengthening exercises, focusing on your back, stomach, and leg muscles. 
Stretching exercises, which keep your muscles and other supporting tissues flexible and less prone to injury"" (WebMD).

124,3832071,My husband has MSRA. Back surgrey.Taking for 3 wks vancomycin sed rate 120. How will we know if meds working?,"Thank you for your reponse. But my question was not really answered. His SED rate is still 120 after about 5 weeks. What is the therapeutic range everyone is talking about. Yes blood work is getting done to make sure his van levels are ok. Can not re-culture the site of infection. It was or is in his back, they will be taking out the staples tomorrow. So the wound will be closed up. I am just not sure what will determine when or if the infection is gone. He feels good no apparent sign of infection. Red cells are a little low, white cells are good. His iron is down. Any help please",Sed Rate range differ depending on gender and age.  The best thing for you to do is talk to your doctor about your concerns. Wounds with mrsa that have closed are difficult to detect if the mrsa is gone.  I work in a facility and deal with mrsa from time to time. There are different types of mrsa. from the lungs to the urine. I asked one of our doctors about mrsa in the wound and how someone can tell if the mrsa is gone and she told me that there is no 100% way of knowing. Usually when the wound closes and the patient has been treated properly with antibiotic (usually vancomycin) it is considered to be treated. If the wound heals with no signs and symptoms of infection (no swelling or redness) then there is no infection.  She also told me that everyone has a small amount of mrsa in the body. It is the level of mrsa that the person needs treated.  If his red blood cell count is low and iron is down it might be good to have him on an iron deficiency otc med. He might be anemic.  The best advice I can give you is ask your family physician and also your surgical doctor of your concerns. This is also why they get paid.  I hope I helped you in some way.,infection,,Female,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I am just not sure what will determine when or if the infection is gone.,infection,,,,,What is the therapeutic range everyone is talking about.,,,,,,Not applicable,,,

127,3890378,long term effect from migraines?,"i have had migraines since i was about 8 years old (28)now.
they get worse and worse over the years,and i hate taking so much medicine.is there long term damage from migraines,i mean that much pressure and pain can't be good in the long run,sometimes i feel like i'm going to die from the pain.
i think sometimes this crap is going to seriously kill me,like give me an aneurism or something.can something like this happen?","Possible symptoms of migraines
Intense throbbing or dull aching pain on one side of your head or both sides. 
Nausea or vomiting 
Changes in how you see, including blurred vision or blind spots 
Being bothered by light, noise or odors 
Feeling tired and/or confused 
Stopped-up nose 
Feeling cold or sweaty 
Stiff or tender neck 
Light-headedness 
Tender scalp 

Are there different kinds of migraine headaches? 
Yes. The most common are classic migraine and common migraine.

Classic migraines start with a warning sign, called an aura. The aura often involves changes in the way you see. You may see flashing lights and colors. You may temporarily lose some of your vision, such as your side vision.

You may also feel a strange prickly or burning sensation, or have muscle weakness on one side of your body. You may have trouble communicating. You may also feel depressed, irritable and restless.

Auras last about 15 to 30 minutes. Auras may occur before or after your head pain, and sometimes the pain and aura overlap, or the pain never occurs. The head pain of classic migraines may occur on one side of your head or on both sides.

Common migraines don't start with an aura. Common migraines may start more slowly than classic migraines, last longer and interfere more with daily activities. The pain of common migraines may be on only one side of your head. 

How long do migraines usually last? 
Migraines may last from 4 to 72 hours. They may happen only once or twice a year, or as often as daily. Women are more likely to have migraines than men.

What things may set off a migraine? 
Certain things that can set off migraines in some people include the following:

Strong or unusual odors, bright lights or loud noises 
Changes in weather or altitude 
Being tired, stressed or depressed or the let-down after a stressful event 
Changes in sleeping patterns or sleeping time 
Certain foods (see the list below), especially those that contain tyramine, sodium nitrate or phenylalanine 
Missing meals or fasting 
Menstrual periods, birth control pills or hormones 
Intense physical activity, including sexual activity 

 Foods that may trigger migraines
Aged, canned, cured or processed meat, including bologna, game, ham, herring, hot dogs, pepperoni and sausage

Aged cheese

Alcoholic beverages, especially red wine

Aspartame

Avocados

Beans, including pole, broad, lima, Italian, navy, pinto and garbanzo

Brewer's yeast, including fresh yeast coffee cake, donuts and sourdough bread

Caffeine (in excess)

Canned soup or bouillon cubes

Chocolate, cocoa and carob

Cultured dairy products, such as buttermilk and sour cream

Figs

Lentils
 Meat tenderizer

Monosodium glutamate (MSG)

Nuts and peanut butter

Onions, except small amounts for flavoring

Papaya

Passion fruit

Pea pods

Pickled, preserved or marinated foods, such as olives and pickles, and some snack foods

Raisins

Red plums

Sauerkraut

Seasoned salt

Snow peas

Soy sauce
 
 What about prescription medicines? 
People with more severe pain may need prescription medicine. A medicine called ergotamine (brand name: Ergostat) can be effective alone or combined with other medicines. Dihydroergotamine (brand names: Migranal, D.H.E. 45) is related to ergotamine and can be helpful.

Other prescription medicines for migraines include sumatriptan (brand name: Imitrex), zolmitriptan (brand name: Zomig), naratriptan (brand name: Amerge) rizatriptan (brand name: Maxalt), almotriptan (brand name: Axert), eletriptan (brand name: Relpax) and frovatriptan (brand name: Frova).

If the pain won't go away, stronger medicine may be needed, such as a narcotic (brand name: Stadol nasal spray) or medicines that contain a barbiturate. These medicines can be habit-forming and should be used cautiously.

129,3992515,Calling all doctors! The Mysterious pain?!?,"I remember back when I was about 10. I had an extremly bad pain on my right side. (Im 13 now) the pain sort of came on suddenly! It hurt really badly all that day till I was in tears. My parents and my doctor thought it could have been appendicitis. But later the next day it all went away! I dont think I had a fever or anything so it probly wasnt appendicitis. But im still curious about what it may have been?? It hurt right where my appendix was! It hurt ALOT i was crying so much. So i dont know why it just suddenly went away like that? Till this day nothing simular has happend sence.

What do you think it may have been?","10 seems a little young to begin menses, but possible.  And, a infected lymph node wouldn't spontaneously go away in one day.  I am pretty sure you would know if it were a kidney stone, because it doesn't just go away in a day, either (personal experience)  plus you would have notice some blood in urine.

It still could have been your appendix.  You won't get the fever until it ruptures.  Acute Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix, your body is always getting inflammation, and it can get rid of it.  Your body might have done just that.  If you didn't have it removed, which sounds like your didn't.  You still could do it again.  If it happens over and over in your life.  It's called chronic appendicitis.  This usually doesn't happen, because the ER doctors usually take it out, just in case.  If it ruptures, the contents of your intestines with all its germs get into your abdominal cavity causing a massive infection that could kill you.  And, if it doesn't because you made it to the hospital soon enough, it's a mess to clean out.  So, better safe than sorry in their opinion and just remove it.  

Or, it could have been something large passing through your intestine.",Mysterious pain,12-17 years old,,,,,,,,,,,,,It hurt really badly all that day till I was in tears.,extremly bad pain on my right side,,,,,,,My parents and my doctor thought it could have been appendicitis.

131,4033465,What is this bumpy lump of fat on my thigh?,"So after I lost a bit of weight a few months ago, I noticed that I have this hand size lump of bumpy fat (feels bumpy to the touch) on one of my thighs.

Thanks.","I was going to say sounds like celluite but cellulite is not tender! It's just a mass of fatty tissue under the skin that is not smooth.  

Not all tumors are fast growers. It could be benign one, but only a doctor can tell u.  Since your lossing weight, it wouldn't hurt to be ck out by physcian to ensure it's fat ur burning and not a loss of muscle.

You do know that cyst can form in the knee area= most common is Baker's cyst.  Definately go to the doctor or orthopedics specialist.

132,4036135,Anyone familiar with speech problems in children having to do with thrusting their tongue when swallowing?,"My daughter has been a little delayed in saying her L's, V's, and Th's.

PLEASE READ DETAILS!?,"Due to a dibilitating illness five years ago and complications from it, I am approximately 150lbs. overweight.  At 5'3"", this is considered morbidly obese, and now that I am finally committed to doing something about it in an effort to improve my overall health, my doctor has prescribed this diet, which also limits salt and sugar, due to diabetes and high blood pressure running in my family.  I am unable to do much exercise due to my range of mobility being limited from the complications of my illness, so my questions are as follows...  a)Is this diet safe?  I don't know ANYONE who lives on 1000 calories per day, and am finding this diet extremely difficult to adhere to, as there are tons more things you are NOT allowed to have than you are.  b)Does anyone have any advice about exercise options for someone with physical limitations?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated, as my weight is contributing to various other health problems, and I have my three children to consider.","I have been on an 850 to 1000 calorie diet for 4 months now, and I've lost 50 pounds.  I spoke with the 5 Dr.'s I work with and my family doctor before I started it, and they all said that it is safe, but to take multi-vit.'s because it is very hard to get all your food groups in your meals.  Exercise can be anything from just sitting in a chair and making circles with your legs and arms, to walking.  You can start out slow, that's no problem.  Don't overdo it, but do as much as you possibly can.  When you start to lose weight, you'll see how easy it is to get up and move around, therefore you can do more exercises.  Drink at least 8 8oz. glasses of water everyday, and fill up with fiber.  It helps you feel fuller longer.  This diet DOES get easier as you get on it, because your lifestyle changes, and you just get used to it.  Trust me, you can do it!  I wish you the best of luck with this.  After the first month, it will get easier and easier.  One thing with low-cal diets is that it lowers your metabolism, but the exercise actually keeps it up, so you kind of even it out.  Sit in a chair and do lifts with weights (5 or 8 pounds), that will burn calories, and build muscle.  The more muscle you have, the more fat you burn.

136,4104582,Midwife or OBYGN?,"Hi, I'm 40 and very happily 8 wks pregnant with our 3rd baby. With my 2 first children I was with a OBGYN who used pain relief whether a hot tub or an epid.(I used both:) but she practices far from where I now live so I'm looking for another Dr. 
My question is since I'm 40 I'm a little concerned with going with a OBYGN since I've heard that they tend to order C-sections more readily if the mother is over 40 (?). I've heard that a midwife might 
not so quickly (?) But Midwifes  don't use epid. as much as a OBGYN does (right?)  I 'd like to know that there's an option of pain relief in the form of medicine, since I was in a lot of pain with my 1st / 2nd and want to be prepared if the 3rd is the same. With my 1st 2 children I had the epid. once I had dilated  to 7. My  Dr. said that if I had  meds. before then the labor might be slowed down, thus might end with a  C-section. 
What do you think? It's been 10 yrs. since I've been  preg. so this is like the 1st time. 
Thanks in advance!","I used a midwife that was in a practice with a OB/GYN and she was WONDERFUL!  I hope and pray that she's around for every single one of my future pregnancies!  The only thing you may have to worry about is your age.  Since you're 40 (not that that's old!) you're more at risk for certain things, and although a midwife will most likely treat you, she may want to work close with a OB/GYN in case of complications.  Also, about the whole epidural thing - my midwife never once mentioned trying to make it through labor without drugs.  She encouraged me to get them if I wanted them.  It was all up to me.  She never discouraged me from having the epidural done.  As for c-sections - I think it's really a case by case thing.  I doubt a midwife is going to let you go without a c-section if you really need one.  If you're really worried about the choice that you're making, do some research and set up a few appts. to speak with some midwives.  They'll be able to answer your questions and reassure you, and I'm sure you'll feel much better about your choice once you have all of the facts.  Congratulations on your pregnancy!!!

I have been taking my time pushing it out and etc. Mine is not hanging out. It goes back in after I finished. So is there any prevention to do for it wonï¿½t come out again? It doesnï¿½t burn or anything. I use this little thing and stick it in my hole just to prevent it. I am not bleeding or anything. So what can I do to prevent it from happening again? BTW I am only 19.","Some of the symptoms of hemmorrhoids are: 

bright red blood covering the stool, 
painful swelling around the anus, 
hard lump around the anus, 
fissures, 
fistulae, 
abscesses, 
irritation and itching (pruritus ani). 

Excessive straining, rubbing or cleaning the anus may worsen symptoms.

Hemorrhoids are caused by too much pressure in the rectum, forcing blood to stretch and bulge the walls of the veins. Sometimes the pressure ruptures the veins.

Medical treatment of hemorrhoids initially is aimed at relieving symptoms. Symptoms can be reduced by: sitting in a a warm tub, Ice packs (to help reduce swelling), usage of a hemorrhoidal cream. Increasing fiber and fluids in the diet will also help (makes softer stool).

In some cases, hemorrhoids must be treated surgically. The doctor will shrink and destroy the hemorrhoidal tissue. 

Adding fiber to your diet

If you suddenly add large amounts of fiber to your diet, you may experience bloating, diarrhea, and severe stomach cramping.

138,4270551,Can You Get Periodontal Disease From Kissing Someone Else?,"I have several questions regarding Periodontal Disease. I read in a magazine that if your toothbrush touches someone else's and they have periodontal disease, chances are you will get it to. 
So my first question is can you get periodontal disease by kissing someone who has the disease?
Second question is, is it contagious? 
Third question, What can you do to prevent Periodontal Disease?
And last question, once you have Periodontal Disease, do you always have it??

Any info you may have, would be greatly appreciated.
And for the wise a&& who suggests that I brush my teeth, thanks but I already do that!!","Sorry, but you are mistaken.  You cannot ""catch"" periodontal disease (gum disease) from anyone or someone's toothbrush.  It is NOT contagious.  It is caused by the growth of bacteria on the teeth and gums. Bacteria are present in plaque, a clear, sticky substance your mouth produces. If plaque is not removed promptly, it builds up on the teeth.

Prevention is simple:
Brush your teeth in the morning, after meals and snacks, and before bed using fluoride toothpaste. 
Try an electric toothbrush that has a rotating and oscillating (back-and-forth) action. This type of toothbrush is better at removing plaque.
Use an antiseptic mouthwash, such as Listerine, or a fluoride or antiplaque mouthwash. 
Floss once a day.  
Use disclosing tablets periodically so you can see if you are brushing effectively. 
See your dentist regularly to have your teeth cleaned and checked. 

No, you won't always have it as it is treatable..especially in the early phases.  If you ignore it, it will progress and tissue damage and lead to permanent tooth loss.",Periodontal Disease,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,"So my first question is can you get periodontal disease by kissing someone who has the disease?

For visual the bottom of my right foot was facing my left foot. Heard some pops (many of them) as I went down. Figured it was a nice sprain. Plenty of swelling and pain with pressure, but I'll live.

Also to mention they are more sore on the sides...that never happens.  Has anyone ever had this happen to them and ended up preggo?,"Check to see if these relate and then go to your doctor.

Tender, swollen breasts
One of the early signs of pregnancy is sensitive, sore breasts caused by increasing levels of hormones. The soreness may feel like an exaggerated version of how your breasts feel before your period. Your discomfort should diminish significantly after the first trimester, as your body adjusts to the hormonal changes. 

Fatigue
Feeling tired all of a sudden? No, make that exhausted. No one knows for sure what causes early pregnancy fatigue, but it's possible that rapidly increasing levels of the hormone progesterone are contributing to your sleepiness.

You should start to feel more energetic once you hit your second trimester, although fatigue usually returns late in pregnancy when you're carrying around a lot more weight and some of the common discomforts of pregnancy make it more difficult to get a good night's sleep

Nausea or vomiting
If you're like most women, morning sickness won't hit until about a month after conception. (A lucky few escape it altogether.) But some women do start to feel queasy a bit earlier. And not just in the morning, either ï¿½ pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting can be a problem morning, noon, or night.

About half of women with nausea feel complete relief by the beginning of the second trimester. For most others it takes another month or so for the queasiness to ease up. 

Increased sensitivity to odors
If you're newly pregnant, it's not uncommon to feel repelled by the smell of a bologna sandwich or cup of coffee and for certain aromas to trigger your gag reflex. Though no one knows for sure, this may be a side effect of rapidly increasing amounts of estrogen in your system. You may also find that certain foods you used to enjoy are suddenly completely repulsive to you. 

Abdominal bloating
Hormonal changes in early pregnancy may leave you feeling bloated, similar to the feeling some women have just before their period arrives. That's why your clothes may feel snugger than usual at the waistline, even early on when your uterus is still quite small. 

Frequent urination
Shortly after you become pregnant, you may find yourself hurrying to the bathroom all the time. Why? Mostly because during pregnancy the amount of blood and other fluids in your body increases, which leads to extra fluid being processed by your kidneys and ending up in your bladder.

This symptom may start as early as six weeks into your first trimester and continue or worsen as your pregnancy progresses and your growing baby exerts more pressure on your bladder. 

A missed period
If you're usually pretty regular and your period doesn't arrive on time, you'll probably take a pregnancy test long before you notice any of the above symptoms. But if you're not regular or you're not keeping track of your cycle, nausea and breast tenderness and extra trips to the bathroom may signal pregnancy before you realize you didn't get your period. 

Your basal body temperature stays high
If you've been charting your basal body temperature and you see that your temperature has stayed elevated for 18 days in a row, you're probably pregnant

Doctors said it is common in Japan and Canada. But this boy has never travelled to oversease countries. So they tried their best to treat him but my son died. Thank you.","Hi,

Sorry to hear about your son. 

The disease is called polyarteritis nodosa. It's a disease that causes inflammation in blood vessels which leads to their destruction. 

The disease involves many organs in the body. It can present as a self limited disease that has only skin lesions or as a severe disease that involves many organs which leads to their disfunction, and to death. 

Nothing is known at the moment about the genetics of the disease. In the USA it occurs in 9-17 out of 1,000,000 people. It usually affects people of all ages and is much more common in males than females. 

The causes of the disease are unclear as of today. There is evidence that maybe the immunologic system in the body is responsible, because when checking for values of factors in the blood that usually go up in diseases that have an immune cause, these factors go up in this disease as well. 

These include:
1. antibodies of the type endothelial COH
2. antibodies that are common in other diseases of blood vessels, called ANCA
3. There is also a connection with infection from Hepatitis virus (that causes a liver disease usually). In 30% of people with the disease the virus was found in the blood. It's possible that the body's response to the virus causes the disease.",Polyteritis Nodosa,,,,So they tried their best to treat him but my son died,son died,,,,,,,we wonder where could have the boy got the disease ,polyarteritis nodosa,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes: Whats the cause of this desease,Yes: Last August I lost a 14 year boy,,,,,Yes: Sorry to hear about your son. ,,,

INTRODUCTION ï¿½ Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common cause of infertility in women [1], and is primarily characterized by ovulatory dysfunction and hyperandrogenism. The diagnosis of PCOS has life-long implications with increased risk for infertility, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and possibly cardiovascular disease. It should be considered in any adolescent girl with hirsutism, persistent acne, menstrual irregularity, or obesity.

The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents are presented here. The definition, pathogenesis, and treatment of PCOS in adolescents are discussed separately. (See ""Definition, pathogenesis, and etiology of polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents"" and see ""Treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents"").

CLINICAL FEATURES ï¿½ It is important to appreciate that PCOS is a syndrome, not a disease, reflecting multiple potential etiologies and variable clinical presentations. Adolescent girls with PCOS may present with hirsutism, menstrual irregularities, obesity, acanthosis nigricans, premature pubarche, and/or precocious puberty (show figure 1). Any one of these findings may be the sole feature of the syndrome. Treatment-resistant acne, scalp hair loss, seborrhea, or hyperhidrosis also may be presenting chief complaints.

Hirsutism ï¿½ Hirsutism is defined clinically as excessive sexual hair that appears in a male pattern [2]. Hirsutism is commonly graded according to the Ferriman-Gallwey system, which quantitates the extent of hair growth in the most androgen-sensitive areas (show figure 2). In adult women, a score of <8 is normal, 8 to 15 indicates mild hirsutism, and >15 indicates moderate to severe hirsutism.

Hirsutism must be distinguished from hypertrichosis, the generalized excess growth of hair that sometimes occurs on a hereditary basis, or in patients taking glucocorticoids, phenytoins, diazoxide, or cyclosporine. Hypertrichosis is distributed in a nonsexual pattern (eg, generalized distribution or more prominent distribution on the forehead or shoulders) and is not caused by excess androgen, although it may be aggravated by excess androgen.

Acne vulgaris, pattern alopecia, seborrhea, hyperhidrosis, and hidradenitis suppurativa are considered to be hirsutism equivalents [3]. Hyperandrogenism should be considered in adolescent females who have inflammatory acne that is unusual in its age of onset (before midpuberty), severity, persistence, or unresponsiveness to standard therapy.

Hirsutism and hirsutism equivalents are variably expressed manifestations of excess androgens that are present in approximately two-thirds of hyperandrogenic females [2,3]. The absence of hirsutism in approximately one-third of hyperandrogenic women appears to be because of relatively low sensitivity of their pilosebaceous unit to androgens. In addition, hirsutism may be absent in young adolescents whose hyperandrogenism has not evolved fully.

Not all hirsutism is caused by hyperandrogenism. Approximately one-half of mildly hirsute women and one-sixth of moderately hirsute women do not have androgen excess, but have idiopathic hirsutism. (See ""Evaluation of women with hirsutism"").

Ovarian findings 

Polycystic ovaries ï¿½ Although PCOS in adolescents has clinical and endocrine features similar to those in adults, the detection of polycystic ovaries with ultrasonography appears to be less sensitive in adolescents (show radiograph 1) [3]. In a comparison of consecutively studied hyperandrogenic females, polycystic ovaries were found in 55 percent of adolescents and 75 percent of adults. This difference, however, may reflect the limitation of imaging virginal adolescents by the abdominal route compared with the higher-definition transvaginal route used in adults. A polycystic ovary may not develop until two or more years after menarche [4].

My guess is the numbness is caused by pressure (impingement) on a nerve.

If you're still active duty, avoid the blame game on your doctor...they'll all be afraid to help you.

Start with sick call and complain about the numness.
You'll get a profile and a weeks supply of Ibuprofen.
After the profile expires, complain again...you may get lucky with an x-ray referal.
The x-rays will turn out non-conclusive and you'll get another profile and more Ibuprofen.
At that point you can ask for an MRI...if they deny you; ask to see a civilian doctor.

If you can't get a referal for a civilian doctor...go to a civilian med station at the mall on a Sunday. Tell the civilian doc every last detail. Hopefully, you'll get that MRI and they can see what went wrong or what is wrong.

The Sciatic nerve guess is a good one...but the numbness from an impinged sciatic nerve will continue up your foot and into your leg.

I need to get back to work, having earned zilch since December 14th. Best answer so far came from Amy, thanks Amy!Shall follow her advice, as she had her op quite near my hometown. All I read it bad news, wish I'd never had it done now. Thanks!","Courtyard worker.  I see folks like you in my office frequently.  Your story is so common there is a syndrome named after it- failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS).  Unfortunately you are probably going to have these problems to some degree or another for the rest of your life.  Far too often people jump right into drugs and surgery and fail to explore the other options that are far less invasive and, frankly more effective (70% of back surgeries fail).  There are literally hundreds of options and you have already mentioned one, decompression.  If you had a spinal fusion, which it sounds like you did, it's too late for that.  They bridged the spinal joints with bone and now there is to joint to decompress.  The best option you have now is chiropractic (it was your best option five years ago too, but it's a little late for that now).  If you had L4-S1 fused, the problem you are facing now is that L3 is having to do a ton of work... a lot more work than it was designed to do.  Chiropractic can help to make sure that L3 stays healthy and isn't the next to go.  Your Doctor (chiropractic not medical) should also ensure that your pelvis is free of distortion.  This will help.

12,1093048,Is Carcinoma In Situ Cancer?,"I had an abnormal ""pap"" a few weeks ago. The report said High Grade Intraepithlial leison emcompassing moderate and severe dysplasia. After consulting with my GYN he said it definately was not cancer. I had a colposcopy/biopsy and it confirmed Carcinoma In Situ. I have read several articles and some say it is cancer confined to the cervix and others say it is pre-cancer. My doctor seems evasive when answering questions and acts like this is no big deal. I am confused, worried, depressed and notably horrified. Please give any info regarding this topic","The word carcinoma means the cells are malignant. A prefix attached to the word carcinoma will tell you where the carcinoma is growing and the kinds of cells that are involved. An adenocarcinoma, for example, is a carcinoma made of glandular cells. When you see the word oma by itself, it means ""benign."" An adenoma refers to a clump of benign glandular cells, a fibroma refers to a clump of benign fibrous cells, and so on.

The words in situ and invasive are used in conjunction with a carcinoma or a sarcoma. In situ means ""in one place."" A carcinoma in situ is cancer that is confined to a specific area and has not spread. This is good news and means your cancer is not invasive. Invasive carcinoma is cancer that has spread to surrounding tissue, the lymph nodes, or other organs. This is not good news and means your cancer can spread.

Back then, cold sores weren't acknowledged as related to herpes, and no one knew how quickly they could cause genital herpes, so people weren't precautious about the virus at all.

Now, I know that it's dangerously contagious, because when the sore first broke I touched it and rubbed my eye in the same day, and now I have pink eye, and I gave that to my husband ... arghhhhh!!!!  I want to be precautious about this, so here's my questions:

1)  How contagious is the virus after the sore heals up?

2)  Could my husband already have contracted it from me sexually, even when I had no open sore?

3)  After the sore heals, how long should I wait before going back to sexual activities?

4)  Is it dead-set that my children will have this virus?

5)  How contagious am I to others on the street, people at work, etc?","You were so misinformed

*HSV-1 is not hereditary

*You can only spread it by kissing, or drinking from the same glass if you have an open sore.

*Once the sore is dried up and clear, you are no longer contagious. 

*Your children will only get it if you kiss them or drink after them from the same glass, when you have an open sore.

*You are not contagious to people on the street.

*You can pass HSV-1 to the genital area by performing oral sex if you have an open sore, so wait until it is dried and cleared away.

*You don't think you can get Pink eye from HSV-1, but you can with gonorrhea, chlamydia, and other bacterial infections.

*The one and only thing you can do with a flair up is WASH YOUR HANDS after you touched the infected area to prevent spreading it.

I can't count the number of time a patient has said ""I had a root canal last year.  yet on the X-ray there is no evidence of an root canal ever being done.   Patients misidentify Pulpal Therapy (pulpectomy) with Root Canals.   they go to the dentist.  The dentist is busy talking in dental tongue and he or she nods and goes home.   They go in with pain, go home out of pain,  "" oh , yeah must have been a root canal.""
that said.  Even the best Root canals even fail, done by the best Specialist.   You can't say so & so did wrong based on the patients impression.

Patients diagnosed neurogenic bladder usually dont totally recover. However, appropriate treatment may produce excellent results. Distinguishing between the hypotonic and the spastic neurogenic bladder is important because these conditions are treated differently. A patient diagnosed with neurogenic bladder will need continued monitoring for urinary tract infections and kidney function.

Treatment may include:

*insertion of a catheter or hollow tube (to empty the bladder at regular intervals)
*prophylactic (preventive) antibiotic therapy (to reduce the incidence of infection)
*placement of an artificial sphincter - a procedure that involves placing an artificial cuff around the neck of the bladder that can be inflated to prevent urinary incontinence and deflated when it is time to empty the bladder. You will still require intermittent catheterization to completely empty the bladder.

In the morning I wake up feeling fine.  Then after the exercise then the symptoms would occur.  Help me please.  Thanks","reactive hypoglycemia means that your blood sugar changes throughout the day for different reasons.  when you exercise, you use a lot of your body's energy (sugar).  drinking water obviously isn't enough for you.  it may seem kinda counter intuitive, the opposite of what you would think, but you might have to snack after working out.  The snack should be a light food, otherwise you could end up feeling nauseous which isn't good either.  Try a yogurt or (maybe) fruit.  Your body is having a problem regulating sugar.  Stop eating ""only sometimes"" and start (the very unattractively named) grazing.  Eat low sugar, low fat and carb, healthy food constantly.

10,218962,Diagnosed Diabetes?,"Hello all, im new in the forums and to diabetes as well. However i have a Question i went to the doctor like a month ago due to a few palpitations i had (not related to diabetes i guess), and he ordered a bunch of tests for me to do.

In the Fasting one i had 92 on the sugar count (i have always been in the 85-95) range all my life, however he decided to make the glucose tolerance test, the reading i got when i got there was 91 then after the first hour i got 210 he said the maximun was 200, and then in the second hour i had 170 he said the maximun was 140, by the third hour i was back to 86. After seeing my results he said i was a Diabetic prescribed no meds only to lose weight (im like 40 pounds overweight) and exercise.

Im also been taking beta blockers a week and a half prior to the test (25mg every night) and i wondered if that may influence the test somehow, so what do you guys think?","Sorry, I don't know the answer to the beta blocker part of your question.  If you're continuing to take them I strongly suggest you do some online research; there's a lot of junk info to wade through, but it will give you a better idea of side effects, differing opinions, etc.

As to the diabetes diagnosis:  I think you've been diagnosed pre-diabetic.  If it were full-blown diabetes you WOULD be on medication.  I had the same diagnosis, and with some lifestyle changes (excuse the phrase) I brought my sugar back into the normal range within 3 months.  Some things to do:

1)  Avoid processed sugar and processed grains.  READ LABELS.  Lots of things have high fructose corn syrup in them.  And if the first ingredient is ""wheat flour"" it's been processed.  You're looking for bread whose first ingredient is ""whole wheat flour.""  It's not that you can never eat them, but try to avoid them whenever possible.  It's hard to do if you're eating out a lot.

2)  Increase your fiber intake, especially soluable fiber.  Oatmeal, apples, there's plenty of information about this on the internet.  Lots of soluable fiber helps your body regulate the insulin/sugar balance.

3)  Excercise.  A simple 20 minute walk after lunch or dinner.  Put on some music and dance.  You're not trying to buff up or lose weight, but to increase your metabolism.

4)  If you live where you can go to a reputable acupuncturist, I really recommend you give it a try.  It can really help balance your system, which is the goal you're aiming for.

5)  Take 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon every day.  This is not as nutty as it sounds.  There's some excellent research that it helps long term diabetics -- even my doctor had heard of it! -- and it can't hurt.

If you cut down on processed sugar and grain, and move you body more, you will lose weight, although slowly.  I would NOT recommend going on a diet of any sort, because you're trying to get your body to work in a more balanced and efficient way, and any kind of extreme eating is going to screw that up.

12,241434,Probability of spreading oral herpes?,"I have had fever blisters ever since i was little.  I've always been unsure of how contagious they are, and now I get the impression I could spread them to anybody I have intimate physical contact with.  Are they so contagious, even *without* an outbreak, that i need to tell everybody I've ever kissed before that they could potentially be spreading oral herpes as well as to other areas?  My fever blisters heal in two days with medication.  Is the healing time that quick for genital herpes?

People with a medical background answering this question would be more helpful...Thanks!","I am sorry to say but Mike is WRONG:
There are two types of Herpes,  Herpes simplex type I or II. Either type can infect the mouth or genitals (if you're really unlucky you can have 4 lifelong infections going at the same time: HSV1 and 2 in the upper body, HSV1 and 2 in the lower body. This would be very rare). When your incfected, the virus ""hides"" in the nervous system between outbreaks. It will protect you from a new infection of the same type, not of another type.
Only about 25% of Americans over the age of 12 DO NOT have antibodies against one of the two (standard test for exposure and infection).
HSV1 is extremely prevalent (very easy to pass on, quite innocently, just by an injudicious kiss to a baby). Most everybody (up to 90% of the population) has antibodies against HSV1 by the time they're 50.
About 20 to 30% of the population has antibodies against HSV2, more women than men (infection is easier for females), but HSV1 is fast becoming a major cause of genital herpes.
Most people with HSV1 have just ""fever blisters"". Some have it bad, a terrible rash from the nose down to the chest, inside the mouth, it looks like a case of pox. It can last a few days to over a week. Genital herpes is basically the same on the genitals, blisters and lesions, individually different how bad. 

Now about transmission: It mostly happens when you have a blister/blisters going, through direct skin-to-skin contact. Avoid physical contact with the area from the time of the first symptoms (tingling, itching, burning) until all sores are completely healed, not just scabbed-over. Also try to prevent self-infection to other areas of your body. Wash your hands with soap and water if you touch a sore. Better yet, don't touch the sores.
Unfortunately, the virus can sometimes  spread , when no signs or symptoms are present. This is called ""Asymptomatic Transmission."" Often people don't know they are infected, these people may have symptoms so mild they don't notice them at all or else don't recognize them as herpes. They can also spread it. Still, asymptomatic transmission appears to be far less likely than spreading the virus when lesions are present.",oral herpes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,Yes: Probability of spreading oral herpes?,,,,,,Not applicable,,,

9,971440,what could these pains be?,"this morning, after my boyfriend and i had sex, i started getting a small pain, almost cramp like but not quite, in my lower abdomen.  the sex was normal, nothing rough or really overly deep or anything like that.  so i just laid there thinking it would go away, but the pain got worse, and spread around my whole lower abdomen into a more sharp pain.  it felt a little worse on my left side too.  i've had kidney stones before, and if it hadn't started in the middle i would have thought it could've been that.  my mom had endometriosis when she was younger, as well as some of her sisters.  could it be something like that?  i didn't know if it could perhaps be anything to do with implantation as well, because lately i've been a little emotional, my breasts feel sore and fuller too.  or could it just be ovulation perhaps?","With your family history, it could likely be endometriosis. However, pain in the abdomen is very hard to nail down. Your other symptoms could be due to a number of things, either related to the pain or not.

Thanks.",i have been taking glucophage 2 a day for years. the research shows that as medicines go it is quite safe. it works by sensitising the receptors on the cell walls to take up sugar from the blood that the cells cannot do without glucophage. it DOES NOT pump out more insulin like a diferent kind of diabetes medicine. excess insulin in the blood damages cells so glucophage is good. just take your blood tests now and then to check your liver function just in case. andrew g is wrong. it does not cause sugar death and it is almost impossible to go into a coma like the wrong dose of insulin can do. sugar swings are smoothe. other meds that pump out insulin are worse than glucophage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,She mentioned I'd have cramping and diarrhea.,Glucophage,,,,,,,Yes: I was wondering if anyone else here was on it and what experiences they have had with it.,,,,,,No,,,Glucophage
12,1386614,General Anxiety Disorder?,"I am not sure I have GAD or not.

I have been having chronic insomnia for more than 10 years now.  I couldn't turn off my brain at night.  Even if i manage to fall to sleep, i would only sleep 6 to 7 hours at most and i feel dead tired in the morning.  (I generally need 9 hours of solid sleep each night in order to function properly the next day.)  BUT, if i go to bed (at or near bed time) just to lie down and rest (eg, before taking bath) without the intention of actually sleeping, i would fall to sleep pretty fast.  [Strange, I don't know why.]

I've been having this problem since 10 years ago, at which time i started to have the following feelings: (i) hopelessness, (ii) loneliness, (iii) anxiety, (iv) lack of energy, desire, etc

I am taking Remeron now, and, as a result, don't have any sleeping problem.  But, obviously I don't want to take it forever.

My questions are: 
(a) What's my problems? and 
(b) is Cognitive Behavioural Therapy the [better] answer to my problem?","Sounds like you might have a GAD-Depression combo (not exactly the two-for-one deal you were going for, huh?) A few things could be going on: the sleeplessness could be causing the anxiety and feelings of hopelessness (because, as I'm sure you know, not getting enough sleep can really mess you up), OR the anxiety and hopelessness could be causing your sleeplessness. 

I recommend going to the doctor (your regular doctor is fine) and telling him or her what's been going on. He or she may take you off the Remeron and put you on an antidepressant/antianxiety med, like Lexapro, which helps both those symptoms. Of course, the catch 22 in all of this is some of these meds cause insomnia, so your doctor may prescribe a light sleep aid to take before bedtime. 

As far as cognitive behavioral therapy, I'm not sure how much that would help you. Instead, your doctor may recommend talk therapy to help you cope with these feelings. Either way, be sure to talk with your doc first and get his or her opinion on the whole situation--and be very straightforward with what's going on. 

Personal tip: if you do end up taking another med that causes insomnia, try taking a Melatonin supplement in lieu of a prescription sleep aid. You can find it in the supplement aisle in any drug store. They come in 3mg and 5mg strengths. It also won't interfere with any other meds you might be taking, because melatonin is already produced in the brain. It's really made a difference for me :)

13,1483105,Lasik/Laser eye surgery?,"I have read a few questions and answers.  I am aware of prices and risks.  Can anyone who has had this surgery tell me about the prep before the surgery.  Someone said he had to wear his glasses for a few weeks right before he had it done.  And any other side effects other than the halo light?  Also, I read a few people said about only getting 1 eye done so they could read...I don't understand this?  Why only 1 eye, wouldn't it be blurry trying to see like that?  I know when I have 1 contact out it is not that easy to see.  But, anyways, I'd appreciate some opinions and feedback!  Thanks!
Prep","You'll need to wear your glasses (leave your contacts out) for two weeks prior to surgery (that's the FDA recommended waiting time for soft contact wearers -- it's longer for people with hard contacts of toric or RPG lenses).  This is necessary because your contact lenses change the shape of your eye; you want your eyes to get back to normal before they start up that laser, otherwise they'd be doing surgery on a surface that's still changing!

As for getting the eyes done together or at different times...

These days, most people who have Lasik get both eyes done at once.  If you have them done separately, you'll find that it isn't at all like when you take one lens out right now.  As soon as the surgery is over, you'll start seeing an improvement, so the vision in your ""corrected"" eye and the vision in the other eye (with the contact lens) are going to be a lot closer than you think. 

I got mine done 1 month apart because I was having PRK (which has a longer healing time) and they wanted to make sure that Eye #1 was responding well before doing Eye #2.  For two weeks before the second surgery, I had to wear my glasses, so I just popped one lens out of the frame.  It looked a little goofy but it was well worth it knowing I'd never have to wear those glasses or lenses again! 

Other than that, there's not much prep involved until you get to the doctor's office and they give you some drops and maybe some medication.

Afterwards, there can be side effects, some more likely than others.  Glare and halos are most common.  It's also possible that your vision may not become ""perfect"" afterwards, and you have to accept that possibility.  Mine isn't perfect, probably because my eyes were so horrible to begin with (-9) -- but I still consider this surgery the best thing I could ever have done for myself and my health!  Do I get halos?  Yes, at night, and I still say it's worth it!  Pick a doctor who has a great reputation.  Don't be afraid to google him or her to look into his credentials.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Also, I read a few people said about only getting 1 eye done so they could read...I don't understand this?",Lasik/Laser eye surgery,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes: Can anyone who has had this surgery tell me about the prep before the surgery.  ,,,,,,Yes: Whole Answer,,,Lasik/Laser eye surgery

Lupus is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect various parts of the body, especially the skin, joints, blood, and kidneys. The body's immune system normally makes proteins called antibodies to protect the body against viruses, bacteria, and other foreign materials. These foreign materials are called antigens. In an autoimmune disorder such as lupus, the immune system loses its ability to tell the difference between foreign substances (antigens) and its own cells and tissues. The immune system then makes antibodies directed against ""self."" These antibodies, called ""auto-antibodies,"" react with the ""self"" antigens to form immune complexes. The immune complexes build up in the tissues and can cause inflammation, injury to tissues, and pain.",,,,,,,,,"I have recently been noticing dandruff in my hair and have tried a couple shampoos, they didn't work!

20,241832,I live with a veteran who has a severe case of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.?,"Although I love him very much, living with him can sometimes be extremely difficult. He is just now starting to get professional help for PTSD, after being home for a year. I was just wondering if any one could give me some advice on how to help him at home too?

I always considered myself a very patient person, but when he's throwing his ""fits"" as we call them, it is extremely hard for me to not lose my temper also.","PTSD is such a difficult thing to deal with--for both the sufferer and those around them, as I'm sure you know. I'm glad your loved one is getting help (counceling, I hope, and meds.)

Many times, the majority of attention is paid to the sufferer and there is very little thought into how the caretaker is doing. Your health is just as important as his--you need to provide strength and have the will to help him through the roughest of times. 

I dealt with PTSD a few years ago, and though it wasn't nearly as bad as the trauma of war, I'm sure, it's stil hell. 

Have you ever had a nightmare where you swore it was real, then woke up and were so relieved it was just a dream? This is a diluted example of what PTSD is like--only it's all the time, day or night. He's probably reliving the trauma--people dying, constant uneasiness, being prepared for the worst at all times. 

I recommend making your home as much of a sanctuary for him as possible. Put on some soothing music, light a few lavender-scented candles and keep the atmosphere as calm as possible. The key here is to limit the amount of situations where he can become startled or be reminded of his time in the military, which may be what's leading to these ""fits."" 

Again, I'm so glad he's getting help, but be sure to monitor your health as well. If you feel overwhelmed, it might be time to see a councelor who can listen to and understand what you're going through.

There are also surgeons who can destroy the nerves that cause excessive sweatiness. Ask your doctor about drysol for hyperhydrosis as well.

Kidney stone or any kind of stone development is partly due to eating habit and behavior pattern.  So watchout on your diet and how you move about the day should solve this problem completely.

The stone is due to deposit of minerals in your body, most likely in your urine fluid.  There are also bacteria in your urine that will convert your urine into ammonia, which will help form these stones in your Kidney or bladder.  The stone takes anywhere from 4-6 years to form, as long as you take care of youself it shouldn't happen to you.

You should watching out your mineral intake such as calcium and magnesian (salt), just keep it balance and don't eat too much of it.  That should lower your mineral deposit in your fluid.  But don't go on a low-calcium diet, otherwise your body will be lack of calcium and other problem will arises.

You should also watch out for sitting down for a long period of time, since it will slow down your blood circulation in your lower back (kidney) area, just remember to get up and walk around for 5-10 mins every 45-60mins to help your blood circulate.  

Also if you sit down in a chair and lay back your back, it creates pressure / tension in your lower back part of your body.  Try not to lay backward when you sitting down and instead sit straight, a good posture would help your blood flow and ease tension in your lower back.

You also need to drink enough water during the day.  Having water constantly flowing through your body will dilute your urine and help your body get rid of mineral deposit through daily urine discharge.  

By diluting your urine you also decrease the chance of the bacteria converting your urine into ammonia, since your urine is not that concentrated and not much to convert.

The last thing to do is exercise regularly, like jogging / swimming or some kind of sport 2-3 times a week to keep the body in shape.  A good cardiovascular exercise that would boost blood circulation will definitely help you prevent any disease.

28,1883135,Does oxycodone cause edema?,"I have a feeling that my father is back to taking oxycodone.  He finished a rehab program several months ago but He looks really bad recently.  His face stays red as a tomato, he has severe edema (his feet can't even fit into his shoes), constant sweating, and extreme sleepiness.  I asked him if he was back on the pills and of coarse he denied it.  I'm just wondering if these symptoms sound anything like what the oxycodone will do to you.","Oxycodone is a Category 2 Schedule drug with a high risk of abuse. The Symptoms of abuse are what you described. I checked my Mosbys and Tabers Medical Books, and both say the same. I hate to give advice on here unless I see it in bold print.
The only thing higher is a class 1, and thats cocaine...Do you know who is prescribing it? 

Edema can be a reaction, and if he has edema, that can cause grave dangers, of which I am sure you are aware of.
Edema is the increase of interstitial fluid in any organ. Generally, the amount of interstitial fluid is in the balance of homeostasis. Increased secretion of fluid into the interstitium or impaired removal of this fluid may cause edema.

Generation of interstitial fluid is regulated by Starling equation of Tissue Fluid which states that it depends on the balance of osmotic pressure and of hydrostatic pressure across the capillary walls. Consequently, anything that increases oncotic pressure outside blood vessels (for example inflammation), or reduces oncotic pressure in the blood (states of low plasma osmolality, for example cirrhosis) will cause edema. Increased hydrostatic pressure inside the blood vessel (for example in heart failure) will have the same effect.

Abnormal removal of interstitial fluid is caused by obstruction of the lymphatic system, for example due to pressure from a cancer or enlarged lymph nodes, destruction of lymph vessels by radiotherapy, or infiltration of the lymphatics by infection such as elephantiasis.",,,,,,,,,He finished a rehab program several months ago but He looks really bad recently. ,"oxycodone, edema",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes:  I'm just wondering if these symptoms sound anything like what the oxycodone will do to you.,,,,,,Yes: Whole Answer,,,"oxycodone, edema"

I started Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo in March of this year. I have gained, at most, about four pounds while on the pill, but considering I moved to college and my lifestyle habits have changed a lot, I cannot blame the gain entirely on the pill. 
I do know, however, that before I was on the pill, I could lose weight and keep it off incredibly easy. Now, I exercise three to five times a week, for about 45-60 minutes each time, doing both cardio and weights. I also try to watch what I eat (although I don't do as great a job at that). Despite working so much harder now, I have not lost any weight in three months of exercising. I have a feeling the inability to lose weight IS due to the pill.  
This really isn't a vanity issue; my entire family has weight, diabetes and heart problems, so it is very important to me to keep my weight down and under control.
Will getting off the pill for two months or so help me with this problem?","3. Myth: The pill will make me gain weight.
Fact: Most women do not gain weight on the pill. But if you do it is likely to be water retention, limited to about 2 pounds. However, some women find the pill increases their appetite, which in turn causes overeating and weight gain. The solution: Switch to a different birth control pill. http://www.webmd.com/content/Article/105/107875.htm?pagenumber=3

I'm on the pill. Could it be making me fat? By Deb Levine, MA 

May 1, 2000 (San Francisco) -- There may be several reasons you put on weight while on the birth control pill. 
The hormones in the Pill (estrogen and progesterone) can alter water metabolism, sometimes causing fluid retention (called edema). A woman could experience a weight gain of up to five pounds from this temporary side effect that usually begins in the first month and lasts for four to six weeks. Decreasing your intake of salt could lessen this water gain, so you might want to cut down on chips, pretzels, and other salty foods when you're on the Pill. 
In addition, the hormones in some types of birth control pills can cause increased or decreased appetite, leading to weight gain or loss. If you notice a weight change, discuss it with your doctor during your next visit. 
You might also ask your doctor if you can switch to one of the pills that contains a lower dose of estrogen if you are not already taking one. According to a study of 463 women published in the March 13, 2000 issue of the journal Contraception, side effects such as bloating and breast tenderness were one-third less common in women taking lower-dose pills than those taking higher-dose ones, without a loss of effectiveness in preventing pregnancy. 
You should also report to your doctor any problem lasting more than two or three menstrual cycles. And if you have severe pain or swelling in the legs (thigh or calf), severe headache, dizziness, weakness, numbness, blurred vision (or loss of sight), speech problems, chest pain, shortness of breath, or abdominal pain, report them to your physician immediately. These symptoms could indicate a more serious condition such as a heart problem or abnormal blood clotting.

Fibromyalgia associated syndromes

It is not unusual for fibromyalgia patients to have an array of bodily complaints other than musculoskeletal pain. It is now thought that these symptoms are a result of the abnormal sensory processing ï¿½ as described in the previous section. Recognition and treatment of these associated problems are important in the overall management of your fibromyalgia. 

Non-restorative sleep
Cognitive dysfunction
Chronic fatigue
Cold intolerance
Restless leg syndrome
Multiple sensitivities
Irritable bowel syndrome
Dizziness
Irritable bladder syndrome
Neurally mediated hypotension

1. Chronic fatigue: The common treatable cause of chronic fatigue in fibromyalgia patients are: (1) inappropriate dosing of medications (TCAs, drugs with antihistamine actions, benzodiazapines etc.), (2) depression, (3) aerobic deconditioning, (3) a primary sleep disorder (e.g. sleep apnea), (4) non-restorative sleep (see above) and (5) neurally mediated hypotension (see below). A new drug called Provigil is of some help when used intermittently for management of fatigue.

2. Restless leg syndrome: This strictly refers to daytime (usually maximal in the evening) symptoms of (1) unusual sensations in the lower limbs (but can occur in arms or even scalp) that are often described as paresthesia (numbness, tingling, itching, muscle crawling) and (2) a restlessness, in that stretching or walking eases the sensory symptoms. This daytime symptomatology is nearly always accompanied by a sleep disorder - now referred to as periodic limb movement disorder (formerly nocturnal myoclonus). Treatment is simple and very effective ï¿½ DOPA / Levodopa (Sinemet) in an early evening dose of 10/100 (a minority require a higher dose or use of the long acting preparations).

3. Irritable bowel syndrome: This common syndrome of GI distress that occurs in about 20% of the general population is found in about 60% of fibromyalgia patients. The symptoms are those of abdominal pain, distension with an altered bowel habit (constipation, diarrhea or an alternating disturbance). Typically the abdominal discomfort is improved by bowel evacuation. Due to abnormal sensory processing these symptoms may be quite distressing to fibromyalgia patients. Treatment involves (1) elimination of foods that aggravate symptoms, (2) minimizing psychological distress, (3) adhering to basic rules for maintaining a regular bowel habit, (4) prescribing medications for specific symptoms; constipation (stool softener, fiber supplementation and gentle laxatives such as bisacodyl), diarrhea (loperamide or diphenoxylate) and antispasmodics (dicyclomine or anticholinergic / sedative preparations such as Donnatal).

4. Irritable bladder syndrome: This is found in 40-60% of fibromyalgia patients. The initial incorrect diagnoses are usually recurrent urinary tract infections, interstitial cystitis or a gynecological condition. Once these possibilities have been ruled out a diagnosis of irritable bladder syndrome (also called female urethal syndrome) should be considered. The typical symptoms are those of suprapubic discomfort with an urgency to void, often accompanied by frequency and dysuria. In a sub-population of fibromyalgia patients this is related to a myofascial trigger point in the pubic insertion of the rectus abdominus muscles ï¿½ and may be helped by a procaine myofascial trigger point injection).

I posted a question about this procedure, it was agony, and I was in hospital for two weeks over Xmas.  It did not improve, in fact pain was worse than pre-op, so had me back in March 17th for 4th nerve root block.  That kicked in after about 3 weeks.  I would NOT recommend any surgery whatsoever on the spine or spinal cord, until you have tried every, I mean, ever other avenue, including chiropractice, physiotherapy, osteopathy, and a whole bunch of specially programmed exercises.  Keep mobile.  I am about half way back to where I was before surgery, and they tell me it will be a year before I really benefit (!). I am very sceptical.

The pain from sciatica is notoriously difficult to keep under control.  Not even morphine pathes helped in the end.

It's basically a ""pyramid"" workout and this is what you do:

1. Choose the exercise you want to work on.  The first set of repetitions you do, do 12-15 reps on the lightest weight you want to use.  Rest about 30 seconds before you do the next set of repetitions.
2. The second set of repetitions do 8-12 reps with a slightly heavier weight, but not too heavy.  Rest again for 30 seconds and get ready for the 3rd set.
3. Third set choose the heaviest weight you can do (without hurting yourself) but only do 4-8 reps this time.  Rest again for 30 seconds and then move onto the next completely different exercise and repeat this process of pyramiding up again.

Do your entire workout 2-3 times with each different exercise and you will see results quickly. Remember to drink plenty of water and just concentrate on fruits and vegetables and lean protein while you are on this until you have a great time on your vacation.

I do know how you feel.  Unfortunately there is not much you can do aboout this particular cold sore.  But there is something you can do in the future.  

The cold sore virus is from the same family of viruses that causes genital herpes.  Once you have the cold sore virus it is always in your body.  It comes out in times of stress or when your immune system is a bit weak, such as now when you are sick, or if you get too much sun, or if you are very anxious about something.

I don't know how old you are so I don't know if you can sort this yourself.  There is a prescription medication called Valtrex that attacks the cold sore virus.  It was actually developed for genital herpes, but it works wonderfully for the cold sore virus too.  YOu take it at the first tingle of a cold sore and it stops the cold sore in its tracks and stops it from developing.  I used to get cold sores badly.  My family doc prescribed this medication about 5 years ago, and since the first time I took it I haven't had a bad cold sore.  YOu don't have to take it all the time - only for a day or two when you first feel the tingle of a cold sore.  YOu don't have to take the whole prescription as you would if it was for gential herpes.  

I would not consider any other treatment now that I see how effectively this one has worked for me.  The otehr things you see advertised for cold sores do not actually attack the virus - they just help soothe the symptoms.

Still could be GERD(reflux) If GERD is bad enough it can cause respiratory symtpoms. Clearing of the throat is one of the #1 symptoms I hear patients complain of with GERD. You do not always have esophageal burning. He needs a Ph probe or a Nasopharyngoscopy to completely rule out GERD.

Symptoms: frequent cough or clearing of throat, always feeling something in your throat, burning feelin in throat. sore throat, hoarseness/change in voice possibly, if GERD is severe acid may bubble over into the trachea causing asthma like symptoms

Treatments within your control other than medication are:
Don't eat right before bedtime
Decrease alcohol, coffee, and chocolate consumption. Lose weight(if that is an issue), Don't wear tight fitting clothes. Don't eat acidic food citrus fruits, tomato sauce etc. Raise the head of your bed 30-45 degrees.

12,633430,Various cysts.....?,"I was diagnosed with ovarian cysts in September, after having them for a long time, and found out yesterday I now have one on my cervix, that is easily seen and felt during an exam.

They didn't say much, leaving me a little unassured about this problem, but I am assuming that the cyst of my right ovary (which has been the most troublesome) has grown incredibly fast and large, and is pushing everything out of place.

13,650153,Where can I find information on the results of a bipolar person refusing medication?,I'm trying to gather info for a stepparent adoption and my ex has bipolar disorder and refuses to take any medication.  There have been stays in the psych ward and suicide attempts.  My son is autistic and I believe it to be in his best interest if the bio father's rights were terminated.  There has been no contact for almost a year.  My son has problems with routine changes (symptom of autism) and having a bio father pop in and out of his life could be harmful.,"Wow.   I don't know about professional info but I can give you my experience which is kind of the opposite of yours.   My husband is Bi-polar and has only spent a total of 3 months on medication in the last 3 years since he was diagnosed.  I have known him for 14 years (since we were kids) so I have seen a lot of the progressions of this disease.  

My son has ADHD and emotional/psychological issues with changes in his routine (I understand this is more severe with autism).  There have been some problems when my husband has been manic and it disrupts our home-life, and then the hospital stays, yes I am familiar with those stresses.

My husband tried various medications after hospitalization but didn't like them and never gave them time to work.  However now his on Lithium and doing well with his therapy.

Now to turn the tables...
If your ex refuses medication he will likely never be able to provide any stable support.  You probably know this already.  If his past behavior shows a pattern of irrationality, instability and especially if he has attempted suicide then most courts would agree that he could potentially pose a threat to your son.  If your pediatricial would be able to put into writing that your son requires an absolute routine and that his fathers symptoms of the uncontrolled bopolar disorder are too disruptive then that should be enough to atleast get a hearing.  

Look into the standard step-parent adoption to get started (it is much easier than a traditional adoption).  If you think your ex might possibly sign-off on an uncontested adoption I would try that.  If he is more likely to fight you on it then use the information that you know from his past issues as a basis for your arguement.  

Sorry I can't give you more info...this sort of thing varies from State to State.

Even though I've never really been 'diagnosed' with depression, I deffinitely know its worse them most peoples. I just hate making a big deal about things. Earlier this year I tried to kill myself, but when my therapist asked if I needed to be committed, I declined.. because I just don't want to be a problem to people.. Do you think that mental health disorders are real? ADHD, is that just a kid who doesn't listen and needs his ass beaten, like my dad says. Depression, is that just someone who makes themselves depressed, as he says as well? Even though I know he's OCD and so am I, so why would he accept that?","Yes , mental disorders are real. Ask yourself this: If it's possible to have a heart disorder of some kind, then why would it not be possible for the brain to have disorders? The problem with the brain disorders is that they manifest themselves through behavior most times. Unlike most physical ailments that manifest themselves through some physical illness/disability/failure. Since behavior is not physical in nature it is hard for some to understand that there is indeed a real physical problem with the brain. It makes me angry that your father could be so ignorant, at best he'll do you no good, at worst he could possibly harm you by his careless misunderstanding of mental illness.

ADHD is very real as well, kids don't make that up, it would be too difficult for a child to manage faking such an illness.

Depressed people don't ""make"" themselves depressed, again, it comes from a chemical (real physical) imbalance in the brain that manifests itself through behavior, thought, and emotions.

I think your father is narrow minded and chooses to remain ignorant when it would be easy enough to educate himself about these things on the internet. Ignorance by choice is simple stupidity. Since mental illness by it's very nature is intangable, I think many people do not have either the capacity to understand or simply choose to remain ignorant because to truly understand mental illness takes quite a bit of clarity of thought and understanding. The tangible is much easier to deal with as it's right there before your eyes, you see the effects, whereby with mental illness you feel the effects and it's inherent side effects it has on your behavior and thought processes, but there's nothing to put your hands on, nothing to see.

It sounds as if you have been questioning an addiction or over usage of her pain pills for a while now and truth is, although sometimes pain medication is required, unless she is under extreme pain she shouldn't be using the precribed pain medication as her only treatment and it shouldn't be needed on a daily basis.  I endured years of endometriosis and if the endometriosis is so severe as to require so many pain pills ... it may be best to seek another alternative treatment.

As with any assumptions, it is wrong to assume that she is giving false information to her physicians unless of course you have positive proof of this.  Yet, with an addiction to prescribed pain medications it is very possible that one will exaggerate the intensity of their pain and/condition to further their cravings for the drug.  She also may be taking prescriptions that have conflicting effects which could be causing her drowsiness as well as many other problems.  Speak to her openly and if you feel you are certain she has an addiction, try speaking to a family member who may be able to assist you in helping her if that is what course needs to be taken.

Is your brother taking bupropion for depression or another mental disorder? I found on a few web pages that state Concerta should not be taken if the patient has any type of depression or schizophrenia etc....

Also the the Tetracycline....

DRUG INTERACTIONS: It is recommended that tetracycline not be taken at the same time as aluminum-, magnesium-, or calcium- based antacids, such as Mylanta, Maalox, Tums, or Rolaids since, like food, these compounds bind tetracycline in the intestine. Similarly, tetracycline should not be taken with minerals (such as calcium or iron), with bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol) or with dairy products.

Tetracycline may enhance the activity of warfarin (Coumadin) and result in excessive ""thinning"" of the blood, necessitating a reduction in the dose of warfarin. Phenytoin (Dilantin), carbamazepine (Tegretol), and barbiturates (such as phenobarbital) can enhance the metabolism of tetracycline.

If so, don't worry.  The natural progression from pre-cancerous cells to actual cancer of the cervix can take 5 to 15 years.  Make sure you get treatment and a follow-up smear.  Secondly, the inflammation of cells on your cervix caused by the gonorrhoea could be mistaken for pre-cancerous cells.  What you probably need is treatment for the infection followed by a repeat smear 6 months from now.  Your doctor may also want you to attend a coloposcopy clinic to have a closer look at your cervix.  The only way this could effect your future pregnancies is if you need a cone biopsy of the cervix which is unlikely from what you have told me.
With regard to the infection, any infection effecting the pelvic organs can effect your chances of getting pregnant and increases your risk of an ectopic pregnancy.  That said, lots of women have infections for years and still have no problems at all. Worse case scenario is you have difficulty getting pregnant but then IVF treatment nowadays would solve your problem and has good success rates.  So basically, get yourself treated and try not to worry.",,,,,,,,,i'm worried that i may not be able to have children because they both hold some risks in infertility,infertility,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes: can i still get pregnant?,,,,,,No,,,pregnant

 ARTHRITIS - OSTEOARTHRITIS/ RHEUMATOID
 
 
Arthritis is inflammation of one or more joints, usually accompanied by pain, stiffness, swelling, loss of function and over time, changes in structure. Arthritis is associated with many diseases including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, lupus erythematosus, Lyme disease, psoriasis, scleroderma, Reiter's syndrome, Sjogren's syndrome, and ankylosing spondylitis.

Symptoms
Osteoarthritis, usually found in elderly people, develops mainly as a result of the continuous wearing away of the cartilage in a joint. It is the most prevalent form of arthritis. It is characterised by pain and stiffness (especially after exercise), swelling, deformity, and/or a diminished range of motion. 
Bone growths or spurs may develop on the margins of affected joints, increasing pain and decreasing mobility. There may be audible cracking or grating noises when the joint moves. 

Rheumatoid arthritis causes stiffness (especially in the mornings), swelling, and, often, crippling pain. It may also cause fatigue, anaemia and weight loss. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder: it is a ""self-attacking-self"" disease. The body's immune system improperly identifies the synovial membranes as foreign. Inflammation results, damaging cartilage and tissues in and around the joints. Normal spaces within the joints become narrowed and the bones may even fuse together.

Causes
The causes of osteoarthritis can be injury or an inherited defect in the protein that forms cartilage. Mostly, it is a result of the wear and tear related to ageing, diet and lifestyle. Risk factors include obesity, overuse or abuse of joints as in sports or strenuous occupations, and trauma.

The underlying cause of rheumatoid arthritis is unknown.

Natural Therapies
The application of proper diet, and lifestyle changes, combined with nutritional supplements may relieve the inflammation, pain and slow-down degeneration of the affected joints.
Glucosamine- Clinical trials show that glucosamine may help reduce joint inflammation and swelling, increase joint mobility and provide temporary relief of the pain of osteoarthritis. 
Blackmores Lyprinolï¿½ is a natural anti-inflammatory supplement containing a unique patented marine extract. Its potent anti-inflammatory action assists in the maintenance of healthy airways and breathing passages, and may provide relief from joint swelling and arthritis.
Fish Oil 1000 contains omega-3 fatty acids which provide an anti-inflammatory action within the body which may be beneficial for the relief of inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis
 
 Important Notes

If you suspect you are suffering from arthritis, prompt diagnosis will help to determine the type, and therefore, the right treatment and prevention. 

Food allergies may be a cause for some individuals especially if there is only occasional joint pain. An elimination diet, or allergy diet, may be necessary to determine which foods are the offending allergens.

Arthritis is sometimes described as just a symptom of an underlying condition. If you are suffering from arthritis, it is imperative to investigate the health of all the different systems of the body, especially the health of the digestive, circulatory and immune systems. Arthritis is a complex, and also very individual condition requiring individual attention.



Prevention

Exercise is important in both the prevention and treatment of arthritis . It improves muscle strength and maintains mobility.

Overweight and obesity also affect the weight bearing joints, which become irritated and stressed by having to carry too much of a load.

Correct posture is also important in avoiding body weight to be distributed unevenly, and causing stiffness and crippling.

54,2935733,Miscarriage?,"Ok I miscarried the end of last month.  I was told that we need to becareful and wait three months before TTC again. 

Signs of pregnancy subsided. We haven't been as careful as we should have been. I haven't had my period yet. And now,  I am having pms/pregnancy signs again. 

Hypothetically speaking when can a woman get pregnant again?
  
When can I expect my period again? 

Can you get pregnant before your next period, after the miscarriage? Don't you need to ovulate before you have your period? In order to have a period you need to expel blood/old egg...right? I don't understand how this works (In regards to a miscarriage and resuming normal function)

I think it's just PMS, but it's something I want to know. I will be careful going forward...I, of course, want a healthy baby so I am going to way the 3 months.  (This was my first baby/miscarriage)","When i miscarried my period came the very next month when it was due.
your health after miscarriage 

HCG Levels
Most women can expect their levels to return to a non-pregnant range about 4 - 6 weeks after a pregnancy loss has occurred. This can differentiate by how the loss occurred (spontaneous miscarriage, D&C procedure, abortion, natural delivery), and how high the levels were at the time of the loss.
Health care providers usually will continue to test HCG levels after a pregnancy loss to ensure they return back to 5.0. 

tiredness
It is normal to feel emotionally and physically drained following a miscarriage. If possible take a few days off work, and if you can't, make sure you get to bed early, plan rests where possible and postpone anything that isn't urgent.
Make yourself your first priority. 

bleeding
If your miscarriage is complete, you can expect your bleeding to taper off rapidly, i.e. over the next week it should get lighter and lighter and stop. All bleeding and spotting should have stopped by seven days. If it persists or is heavier than a normal period, this indicates something is wrong, see your doctor. While you are still bleeding it is important that you shower, not bath, and that you do not swim in public pools because of the risk of contracting an infection.

pain
When the miscarriage is complete, or after a D&C all pain should cease. Again, see your doctor if you have continuing pain.

temperature
Temperature indicates infection which can result in infertility. If you have one see your doctor urgently. You will be treated with antibiotics and possibly a D&C (or repeat D&C). 

discharge
If you are having an offensive discharge this could also indicate infection so get checked out. 

lactation
This is normal if the pregnancy has lasted longer than 12 weeks and will stop by itself. 

menstrual cycle
Ovulation can occur 14 days after a miscarriage with the next period 28 days after the miscarriage, but there is great personal variation. It may take a few cycles before your regular pattern is re-established. This means that you can become pregnant 14 days after a miscarriage if you resume a normal cycle immediately, but there is a great personal variation. It can take up to 6 or 7 weeks for your next period to come if you had ""natural"" miscarriage (i.e. no D&C or tablets). 

sex
Sexual intercourse should be avoided until bleeding has stopped to prevent the risk of infection. Even though your cervix will be closed again, sperm can travel up through it and introduce infection into the uterus, which is still healing. 

contraception
If you do not wish to become pregnant immediately, you should start using contraception straight after the miscarriage. Note: The pill should be commenced at the time of the miscarriage. You will not be safe until you have taken the tablets for 14 days. 

the physical symptoms of grief
Many women find they experience physical symptoms of grief as well as the emotional aspects. These vary greatly from person to person, and include: 
disturbed sleep and eating patterns 
unexplainable tiredness 
unexpected tears 
disturbing dreams and mental confusion

Be gentle and patient with yourself during this time and take comfort in knowing that these symptoms are normal.

You can get pregnant right away...you are more fertile after you have a miscarriage or giving birth.

59,3284225,"Bloating or IBS or Celiac Disease or Rapid Weight Gain...I'm so confused, answers please!?","I'm a 20 year old female and for the past two months I've been bloated (at least I think).  I lost 10lbs in that last two months but in the past two weeks I've gained 6lbs.  All of a sudden, and I really mean it, I've noticed maybe fat or muscle on my hips because normally my hip bones stick out or are noticeable.  After anything I eat or drink in any amount I bloat up and look like I'm three months pregnant, I don't get it.  Even when I wake up in the morning I feel bloated but yet I'm starving (I'm normally a very hungry person).  I noticed the waist band on my work pants are a little tight...but how could that happen in like two weeks?  I have actually been eating healthier!  Also, I've never had any known allergies but one week in October all of a sudden I guess I got allergies, lol.  Yesterday I think I broke out with a rash after eating or working out, I don't know which one but my face was hot, red, and itchy along my jawline...any suggestions?  It won't let me type anymore :(","It could be celiac, but doesn't scream it or anything.  It would explain the bloating, the weight fluctuations, being hungry all the time.  Celiac is very common -- 1 in 133 people in the US have it, but only 97% of them know it.  There is a rash that goes along with celiac, but that almost sounds like a food allergy reaction rather than celiac.  You can also have an allergy to wheat which is a different reaction than celiac, which is an autoimmune reaction and not an allergy.  Celiac can and does come out of the blue.  Most people with celiac can tell you exactly when their symptoms started.  

BUT, it does sound like you're reacting to something you're eating.   It could be anything from celiac or a true food allergy, to an intolerance or sensitivity.

You said that you had started eating healthier.  Before I found out about having celiac myself, every time I made the resolution to eat healthier I got sick because I heard that eating things such as whole grains and wheat grass were healthy.  Sick as a dog.  If you're concerned that you may be having an issue with gluten, keep in mind that spelt, kamut and sprouted wheat all have gluten in them, no matter what people at the health food store may say (it's a common mistake).  

Some of the other things that are common foods that are also the top food allergens are - soy, dairy, peanuts, other nuts (such as almonds, cashews, walnuts, pecans), eggs, fish, shellfish.  

Dairy can cause some of the same issues as celiac.  There is a protein in dairy called casein that is a seperate reaction than lactose.  It's relatively common for people with celiac to not only be gluten free, but casein free.  

Soy is also a very common thing to react to which is touted as a health cure-all.  There was a while where I had a sensitivity to it and it tore me up.  I'm fine with it now, but for a few months it really messed me up.  It's also difficult to avoid because it's another one of those things that's in everything nowadays.  

Well, I hope this helps.

WHAT to eat for losing weight

 Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, especially NC (negative calorie) food.

* Print these lists. They will be your ... ""Bible"", from now on !
* Dill and parsely - include them in all your salads. Also ognion + garlic.
* Try eat mostly fresh vegs & fruits (whenever possible, of course)
* If you really want a book, then check this out: The Negative Calorie Diet Workbook & Cookbook - eBook (Win95/98 only). Read more about this e-book here.


 Eat fish, chicken, beef, pork. (preferences are in this order)

* If you are a vegetarian, then ignore this!
* Avoid fat meat


 Eat 2-3 slices of bread/day. Don't EVER exclude bread from your diet!

 Snacks between meals (if needed): apples, oranges, grepfruits and other NC fruits

* Don't cheat ... NO cookies, chips, candies, brownies etc! 
* EVEN if they have ""low fat"" indication... They might have low fat, yet they can have lots of CALORIES !!!


 About rice, potatoes, beans, [xxx]nuts, pastry, pasta... you know!

* Don't eat too much of those, at least during the first weeks of the diet. I'm not a low carb addict, but I've noticed weight gains if consuming those in large quantities, especially when associated with other foods.
* If you like them a lot, try and eat them like one meal. A nice delicious plate of spaghetti could be your lunch (never dinner!), followed by a nice big apple. These rich starch foods are not good for dinner!
* At dinner time, chose mainly large mixed veggies salads... with fish, lean meat or cheese (if you are not a vegetarian). 

if u want to lose weight the best food to it are baked potatoes with nothing on it. no salt no nothing just plain. u can eat a 10000000000 baked potatoes till ur stuff and not gain a pound. i heard that from a weight loss tape. the best drink is water or gatorade. thats a start then when you work out do some taeboo. if u want a macine. run with dumbells on a treadmill. u could do the rocky workout. but thats a new story. u could use a butterfly macine i think it works the abs

1) It is not just the amount you eat, but what you eat. Lean meats and vegtables that snap are a good place to start. And by snap I mean fresh and not boiled or doused with better or whatever.

2) Exercise moderatly but for about an hour every other day. Spend half of that walking or running at a good enough pace for you to feel labored. The other half of the time use weights, or exercises such as push ups or situps to get a muscle ""burn"". A gym is also an option, but I don't know if you have the money for or want to spend the money on it.

3) Sleep well. To bed earlier and up earlier. Exercise in the morning when you wake up, not in the evening before bed. 7 hours of GOOD sleep is a must.

4) Occupy yourself with a hobby that keeps your attention for a long period of time. A hobby like this keeps your mind focused and gives less of a chance for snacking from boredom.

That is a good place to start... if you see good results, keep it up and modify to fit you... if it does not, see a doctor AND a trainer 

Keep working out, drink water a lot, eat 5 to 6 meals a day but in small quantities, vegtables are important specially cucumber and lattice, fruits not be eaten after meals except by 2 to 3 hours, minimize the starch quantities in your meals lots of salad is important, your last meal must be before you sleep by 2 to 3 hours
the most important thing is you don't lose patient wait and have a strong will to be as what you want

you might have some more ideas from www.ivillage.com

64,3517296,Is this something neurological or vascular?,"I was biten by a stray cat on Thursday of last week. I had it picked up by Animal Control on Saturday and quarantined. 

Today, I suddenly experienced pain in the back of my head, pain in my right eye, pain in my right leg and the acute, sudden appearance of a black blob/box in the middle of my visual field.

I also felt weak all over, my chest felt heavy and I felt a vague ""blah"" feeling all throughout my hands, arms and shoulders (I was bitten on the left hand and all these symptoms seemed to have arisen in the right side of my body).

The doctor at the ER was sufficiently concerned to order a CAT scan. It turned out normal.

However, he cautioned me to keep on eye on things and to check back with Animal Control to see how the cat is doing (thus far, after nearly 4 days in quarantine, animal control has not contacted me in any way).

I have not worked at a regular job in nearly two years, I sold my car in order to pay my credit card bills, and I work odd jobs around my parent's house to earn enough money to eat.

I have not gone on a date in two years and have not been with a woman in three years.

All of my friends from college have drifted away entirely or lost touch with me, my family constantly nags on me to ""get better,"" and in addition to all of this I am contacted regularly by angels and ghosts from the spirit world, whether on or off medication.

I have contemplated suicide many, many times and I am very, very unhappy.","You need to seek counselling for all of these issues at once. Print off this question that you wrote and take it with you. Then, your therapist can choose which order to deal with what issue in. Good luck. The good news is that if you took the time to ask this question, you are ready for some help. Talking to someone whose objective is great and nothing to be ashamed of.",,,,,"I have contemplated suicide many, many times and I am very, very unhappy.

66,3664816,Help! - Could my boyfriend have caught something? I'm threating!!?,"I have genital herpes. I slept with my boyfriend the other day, and was unaware of any blisters that were present until a while after having sex, my boyfriend then said that the condom had split in the process.. Does this mean he would have definately caught something, or is it a chance that he might not have. I mean in all cases would you catch something off someone if they have an STD if the condom splits??","First does your boyfriend know that you have genital herpes? Just because he wore a condom doesn't mean that he didn't catch herpes Whether you have symptoms or not, you can still transmit the infection. If you are sexually active, condoms can help reduce, but do not eliminate, the risk of spreading HSV.

Genital herpes (also called HSV infection) is a viral infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). It is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) that may cause skin blisters and sores in the genital area, but often causes no visible symptoms. It is possible to get genital herpes through sexual contact with an infected person even if he or she has no symptoms. 

I hope this helps...Be careful sweety",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I slept with my boyfriend the other day, and was unaware of any blisters that were present until a while after having sex, my boyfriend then said that the condom had split in the process.

72,3950368,Do I have a hemorrhoid??,"I noticed a small cyst like mass by my anus. Its not big- about the size of a large pea.  It doesn't hurt but I have problems going to the bathroom. My BM's are very painful but I never thought it would be from this cyst-like mass. It sounds like its a hemorroid but it doesn't hurt when I touch it and it isn't inflammed or red. What do you think it is- doctors opinions will be the most helpful.

If it does't get smaller in a few days I will go to the doctor but I just want some advice on what it might be.

THANKS!","Yeah it sounds like an internal hemorrhoid that only comes out when you use the bathroom.  I knwo about this cuz I have that too and I havent seen a doctor but im about to cuz i had it for a few months now and never took it seriously just becuase it doesn't hurt or cause me any type of discomfort at all.  Only when I have BM it may hurt depending on the size of the bowel...Anywayz i would get it checked which is something im going to do as well...good luck

And plus ive tried a lot of over the counter stuff like Preparation H and other suppositories but they only reduce the swelling but it never goes away.  So preparation H and other things like that won't work

74,4016387,Can taking too much ferrous sulfate cause vaginal bleeding?,"I was recently put on 325mg. of Ferrous Sulfate for mild anemia. I started having severe headaches, stomach cramping, feeling like I was going to throw up, etc....I stopped taking it and started taking a normal multi-vitamin where it says 18mgs is the 100% needed each day, so my gawd, I was taking a LOT. This may seem strange, but while I was on that high dose, I started having light vaginal bleeding, but as soon as I stopped taking that high dose, the vaginal bleeding stopped. Has anyone ever heard of this as a side effect of taking way too much ferrous sulfate??? I know it can cause blood in your stools, so was wondering. Just seems to strange to just be a coincidence. Thanks for any input!!","If you are anemic, you need more than 18 mg of extra iron.  Your body needs much more iron.  Your doctor prescribed what he felt was best.  Also, there are different forms of iron and each one has different milligram dosage requirements for the same effect.  

There are other iron supplements available and in many price ranges.  I take the ferrous sulfate 325 mg now because it is cheap.  But, I do not like it as much as Niferex 150 Forte.  The Niferex with my insurance is $10 a month while the FS is $2 a month.  The Niferex 150 Forte and Ferrous Sulfate 325 mg. are supposed to be equivalent dosages.

When I first started taking Iron, I took the Niferex.  I had to use the ladies room every 45 minutes  for about what seemed like a week.  But, after that, I was normal.  The Niferex regulated me.  

The ferrous sulfate is okay.  But, I do not feel as good using it.  I also take it only every other day or so.  This is because it made me very constipated.  I think I did experience some of the side effects on a short term basis.  I never had the extra vaginal bleeding.  

I am anemic because I had about 15 years of severe periods due to Polycystic Ovararian Syndrome.  So, the extra iron may be beneficial for someone to have a normal period which may account for your light vaginal bleeding.  

I am now back on the Niferex because I felt so much better using it.  I know I said that I take the FS now because it is cheap.  Well, I do; but I use it when I can't make it to the pharmacy for a refill when it is due.  I have a 3 month supply of Ferrous Sulfate left from my last refill.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This may seem strange, but while I was on that high dose, I started having light vaginal bleeding, but as soon as I stopped taking that high dose, the vaginal bleeding stopped.

Stairs were a big thing for me (grasping the railing sounds very familiar).

Um, you can do a quick eyeball check if this is something you have by standing up square with your knees over your toes and slowly bending your knees to about 90 degree. When your legs are bent (you may need a mirror) look to see if your knee caps are directly over your toes or not. If not - welcome to the club (lots of young women have it), believe it or not, you can survive this, and get lots of relief (little things like careful shoe shopping can make a big difference).

81,4276498,Why am I still having flank pains?,"I had a UTI which spread to my kidneys back in March this year.  After four weeks, I had taken Cipro,Penicillin, and my CT scan was negative.  Ever since, I have been experiencing flank pains (dull), without fever, malaise or chills.  I am concerned that there is some sort of kidney damage here.  Is it common to have echos of the flank pains after having such a severe infection?  Any advice will help!","your symptoms are not abnormal, but not common either.  Gerota's fascia around the kidney is full of nerves, and they take a while to ""quiet"" down so to speak.  

Some with chronic pain, may have stretched these fibers to the point where they cannot recover completely, and continue to give off ""false"" pain signals as they try to recover (a layman's explaination for sure).... a bad situation, kidney's have been removed for this type of chronic pain (rare).

If march 06, I wouldn't worry too much.  As allowed by your doctor would use motrin/tylenol combo before the pain starts for about 3 weeks, whether it hurts or not.  After a week of constant use, motrin has anti-inflamatory effects.  Otherwise it is a pain medicine only.  Doctors think the key is to reduce the overall ""inflamtatory"" environment of the kidney.",,,,,,,,," I am concerned that there is some sort of kidney damage here.

I get constant post nasal drip, and it's really dry feeling.  They're always swollen and it's difficult to breath.  

I was put on antibiotics first, that didn't work. Then I was put on 3 different nasal sprays, not sure what they were but I know there were steriods in some of them, they didn't help.  I am currently using what is called a Netti Pot, which you put a mixture of salt water in and run it through your nose, and that helps the soothing.  But nothing FIXES!! Please someone tell me what I need to do!!","The thing with the neti pot is that you must continue to do it.  It's not going to ""fix"" you.  Western medicine encourages us to think we can find a pill to ""fix"" us, but generally it's lifestyle changes that make us healthier.  I don't know about what lifestyle changes would help you, but perhaps a naturopath or ayuvedic physician would.

I was, in fact, ""cured"" by nasal flushes.  But when things get dry, or if my allergies begin to act up, I need to flush daily.  When I feel an infection coming on, I do it twice a day, and when I have an infection, maybe even as frequently as hourly (it helps if you're home in bed drinking fresh organic vegetable broth and resting).  The mixture I use is 8 oz water w/ 1/4 tsp each baking soda and salt.  I don't use a neti pot, I use a baby nasal aspirator, but I don't know how important that difference is.

26,1678675,Do you have Endometriosis?,"Do you have endometriosis? If so what are you doing to help with the pain? I was diagnosed with ""endo"" about 3yrs ago, they tried putting me on birth-control to stop my periods but the birth control made me REALLY sick and made me feel like I was losing my mind so I stopped taking it and never went back to the doctor because I felt like it was useless. I am still in TONS of pain every time I have my period and some times even when I'm not having my period, I've even now begun to ""spot"" between my periods.

I am just tired of all this pain, I am so sick when I am on my period. What should I do??","I dont have endometriosis, but here is what i could find on it. Hope it helps you

The treatments for endometriosis pain include:
NSAIDs and other pain medication: They often work quite well as they not only reduce pain but also menstrual flow. They are commonly used in conjunction with other therapy. For more severe cases narcotic prescription drugs may have to be used.
Hormone suppression therapy: This approach tries to reduce or eliminate menstrual flow and estrogen support. Typically, it needs to be done for several months or even years. 
Progesterone or Progestins: Progesterone counteracts estrogen and inhibits the growth of the endometrium. Such therapy can reduce or eliminate menstruation in a controlled and reversible fashion. Progestins are chemical variants of natural progesterone.
Avoiding products with xenoestrogens, which have a similar effect to naturally produced estrogen and can increase growth of the endometrium.
Continuous birth control pills consists of the use of birth control pills without the use of placebo pills. This eliminates monthly bleeding episodes.
Danocrine is a suppressive steroid with some androgenic activity. Oral Danocrine inhibits the growth of endometriosis but its use is limited as it may cause hirsutism. There has been some research done at Case Western Reserve University on a topical Danocrine, applied locally, which has not produced the hirsutism characteristics. The study has not yet been published in a medical journal.
Gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists (GnRH agonists) induce a profound hypoestrogenism by decreasing FSH and LH levels. While quite effective, they induce menopausal symptoms, and over time may lead to osteoporosis. To counteract such side effects some estrogen may have to be given back (add-back therapy).
Surgical treatment is usually a good choice if endometriosis is extensive, or very painful. Surgical treatments range from minor to major surgical procedures. 
Laparoscopy is very useful not only to diagnose endometriosis, but to treat it. With the use of scissors, cautery, lasers, hydrodissection, or a sonic scalpel, endometriotic tissue can be ablated or removed in an attempt to restore normal anatomy.
Laparotomy can be used for more extensive surgery either in attempt to restore normal anatomy, or at least preserve reproductive potential.
The definitive treatment for endometriosis is a total hysterectomy (removal of the uterus and surrounding tissue) and bilateral salpingoophorectomy (removal of the uterine tubes and ovaries).
For patients with extreme pain, a presacral neurectomy may be indicated where the nerves to the pelvis are cut.
A variety of alternative treatments are being used in patients with endometriosis, including acupuncture and nutrition.

Patients who are pregnant generally have less pain during pregnancy, and it is not unusual to have fewer symptoms after a pregnancy.

The only other suggestion I can make is try a hot water bottle. Just make sure it's not too hot, and rest it on your stomach before you go to bed.

38,678939,I like everything about my new girlfriend apart from she's overweight. What should I do?,It's not just from a looks point of view (I think she's cute actually) but more from a fitness concern. She says she is going to go to the gym but doesn't seem to be doing anything about it. She doesn't eat heaps (around me anyway) but she doesn't have a high metabolism either. I enjoy tramping and getting outdoors in genral and she says she likes the same but she always finds an excuse not to go and I think it's because she's afraid she can't keep up. I have never criticised her about her weight but I feel I may say something soon and I want it to be the right thing.,"First of all, to the guy who said ""get another girl..a slim one of course"" you are mean, and didn't even address the question. Not everyone is as superficial as you are.

Now, if you think she's cute, and are mostly dissapointed that you can't enjoy physical activities with her because she always finds excuses not to go, then I suggest that you kindly explain to her that its something you really enjoy, and something you want her to be a part of, and that you can take it slow if she wants. I think you're right about her being afarid she won't be able to keep up (thats how I'd feel) 

You could also just stop by her house and ask her to take a walk with you, or take her to go swimming at a lake or something...activities that are romantic as well as counting as excersise. Once she is able to be comfortable around you in these sort of situations, she'll agree to them more and more, and most likely start to lose a bit of weight. 

And if she says she goes to the gym, why not suggest that the two of you go together? 

Just keep in mind that healthy weight loss takes a lot or work, pateince and time - and this applies to you as well as her. Be supportive and don't get impatient.

41,2718006,What are some warning signs of skin cancer?,"Well, I've been dating the same guy since the end of January.  He doesn't spend a lot of time in the sun and just recently started because I love it.  I've noticed, now that he has a tan, some white spots on his back.  He has a lot of moles and I've been watching them for any changes.  At first it was just the one, now he has three more and another one starting.  It's a complete lack of pigment, all circular, no irregular shapes, they don't hurt and the largest isn't changing.  It's all in an area where he just got a tatoo?  Could that have something to do with it?  I'm just concerned because more are forming and fairly rapidly.  Any answers would be helpful.  Thank you so much.","Symptoms of Skin Cancer: Skin cancer can look many different ways. The most common sign of skin cancer is a change on the skin, such as a growth or a sore that won't heal. Sometimes there may be a small lump. This lump can be smooth, shiny and waxy looking, or it can be red or reddish brown. Skin cancer may also appear as a flat red spot that is rough or scaly. Not all changes in your skin are cancer, but you should see your doctor if you notice changes in your skin. Melanoma can form from or near a mole, so it is important to have your health care provider check unusual (atypical) moles that are larger than others, have different colors, or that have irregular edges (borders). The American Academy of Dermatology says that if you notice a mole on your skin, look for the simple ""ABCD"" warning signs of melanoma: 

Asymmetry ï¿½ one half does not match the other half. 

Border irregularity ï¿½ the edges are ragged, notched or blurred. 

Color ï¿½ the pigmentation is not uniform. Shades of tan, brown or black are present, causing a mottled, or splotchy, appearance. Dashes of red, white, and blue add to the mottled appearance. 

Diameter ï¿½ the width is greater than six millimeters (about the size of a pencil eraser). Any growth of a mole should be of concern. 

Malignant melanoma usually begins as a mottled, light brown to black flat blemish with irregular edges and is at least one-quarter inch in size. It can turn red, blue or white, or bleed and crust on the surface. 

A skin growth called actinic keratoses (AKs) can be the earliest sign of squamous cell carcinoma. AKs are small, scaly spots that form on body parts that have been exposed to the sun. They may start as small, red, flat spots then grow larger and become scaly or thick, like a wart. Most AKs form on the face or back of the hands

b) dust- wind has kicked up a lot of dust...
c) pollen- there's been a high pollen count (I do have spring-time allergies, so I'm not sure if this is another symptom if the hayfever.)

The tightness under my sternum has always taken many hours to go away- 8-10 hours, sometimes overnight. Occasionally, it will be a little less if I can shower right away and rinse off the dust or pollen.","Firstly, Asthma - The Symptoms are, coughing often at night, wheezing, a tight feeling in the chest and shortness of breath are common. Some people may have mild symptoms,while others have severe symptoms resulting in treatment in hospital.                                   Symptoms tend to be worse at night, and first thing in the morning.
       
                Asthma has become more common in the last 20yrs. In the Uk, more than 5 million people - about 1 in 7 children and 1 in 13 adults are believed to have it.

However, I was on Zoloft for a period of time.  With anti-depressants it takes approximately 4-6 weeks to see the full effects on your mental health.

For me, my body was used to it after the first week or so.  So I would recommend waiting 2 weeks then possibly calling your doctor regarding your side effects.

51,894753,Dr. Sam: HELP!! (for real this time...I can honestly say that I'm scared out of my mind)?,"I got a few crowns about four months ago and since then the gums directly above them have been tender and dark.  I got braces about a month after this.  Everything was fine until about three weeks ago when the gumline just above the crowns became inflamed.  I went to the dentist because i thought I had gingivitis but he said according to the x-rays everything looked fine.  He thinks I may have a small gap or hole between the crown and my gum.  I was given a prescription for pain relievers and antibiotics even though he said they won't do much.  He said that the periodontist may have to cut parts of my gum out and my gums might inflamed due to plaque getting trapped in my gums.  He said that I may have to get the crowns redone. 
Do you think this is something to be dealt with asap or can it wait a month?  What do you think is happening and what might happen if I do nothing but brush three times a day, floss daily, use Crest Pro-Health Rinse daily and use a flouride rinse daily?","I'm here, but a little busy lately...

Again and as always, please remember that I have not seen you or your x-rays and I am just speculating so that you might have a better understanding of what questions to ask the person who is actually treating you.

My first impression is that you should not immediately notice a change in your gums when you get crowns.  Maybe for a day or three, they will be irritated after having the cement cleaned away and so on, but they really should return to pretty much normal within a few days.  This suggests to me that the edge of the crowns (the ""margins"") might not be technically the best possible, because this alone will canuse gum irritation.  I can't see or judge your crowns, but that is a red flag for me.

If you want to wait a month, that is up to you.  Again, I just can't see your gums, can I?  Unless you have something really horrible going on, a month will not usually make THAT much difference.  I am guessing that you want to wait until January 1 for a new insurance year.  Go ahead with the antibiotics for now and see what happens in the next couple of weeks.  Things don't generally move so fast that they are irreversible with minor gum irritations.

I would suggest that you see the periodontist and try to read between the lines and get his/her comments on how the crowns fir your teeth.  Since your dentist refers patients to this periodontist who relies on referrals for a living, you may not get a direct answer, but he/she won't tell a boldfaced lie,either.

In the meantime, you are right.  Just step up your home care to as nearly perfect as you can possibly manage.",gums,,,,,,,,He said that the periodontist may have to cut parts of my gum out and my gums might inflamed due to plaque getting trapped in my gums.,gum,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Do you think this is something to be dealt with asap or can it wait a month?,,,,,,No,,,

Tired, soar back, nauseous does sound like UTI. Best go to doctor and get that checked Right Away. Do Not Leave a UTI because if you do it can do severe damage (scarring) which can wind up preventing you from ever being able to conceive at all.

Do go see a doctor right away about the other symptoms!! If you don't have a doctor-Get One, Now!

Normal valves slam shut without allowing any blood to back-track in the heart.  The swinging door type valves let blood seep back into the previous heart chamber.  Since the report says ""trace"" your doctor will most likely not pursue treatment.

67,3111665,Should I undergo rotator cuff surgery?,"I am a 56 year old man, on disability for back and neck problems. I take care of my 87-year old father.

I have torn the rotator cuffs of both my shoulders and a surgeon says , after an MRI, that I need surgeries--two of them, left first, right later.

Right now, I am mildly inhibited only. I can still bathe, dress, and do basic household tasks. I even pull the start cord for my dad to mow the lawn.

But I cannot push even pillows or clothing up onto a shelf above my head in the closet. And I have mild difficulty in putting clothes out to dry on a clothesline.

I know that all surgery is risky.
I am a recoering alcoholic, too, so I hesitate to go under general 
anesthesia. I also hesitate to have to wear slings or cats on my arms for weeks or months, temporarily becoming more ""disabled"".

it's a big decission - but not that the surgery is over, i'm so glad i did it...

i was in much of the same situation as you were...limited mobility....above my head...but, was still healing from the dislocation...

i have minimal pain - and today being 4 days after, haven't takenthe pain meds at all...my mobility is pretty good...i do have a sling, and will have to do some physical therapy in a week or so, but the doc tells me that after that my mobility should be back to almost normal.....

sling is only going to be on for about 10-14 days...

i work as a counselor for people in 12-step programs - i'm assuming that your fear is for the drugs afterwards?  i;m sure if you spoke with the surgeon he could figure something out...don't use it as an excuse.....

anyway...not sure if i helped or not...in my opinion the surgery isn't as bad as i expected it to be....and only 4 days later it is already feeling ok...

i'm only 32 and didn't want to feel disabled the rest of my life - reaching the top shelf...washing my hair, etc...

After the lensectomy your vision shouldn't be changing, however that surgery does not correct astigmatism so you could do a LASIK retreatment to get rid of the astigmatism.

Teens and up to 25yr olds produce enough from the pituitary gland. It's only as we age pass this, does production slow down. It does'nt stop though - people who work out hard and regular show increased levels in comparison to others. 

There is no evidence to date that if you supplement, then stop - your natural production will decrease further because of the 'un-natural' supplementation.

We looked into this with the rave drug 'xtasy' (MDA) and the release of serotonin - once again, the neurotransmitters regulated themselves. This was only one study though.

65,3319312,I seriously need HELP?,"I have an eating problem, I know that i have ben stressed out lately and I seem to be self medicating with food, most of all I dont want to admit that it is related to stress and so I just associate my eating habits with a growing appeite. So I am asking does anyone know of a diet pill that surpresses my  appeite and reduce stress level? I know there are tons of diet pills but one that specifically deal with decrese of appeite and stress. i.e last week i weighed 120lbs know Iam up to 126lbs is it normal to gain 6lbs in a week?","The diet pill will only work for a short period of time because your need to eat will overpass it because you have not dealt with your ""emotional eating"" problems.  When you have emotional eating problems, you don't eat because you are hungry, you eat because you are having to deal with an emotional problem.  So having   no appeite with the help of a diet pill means nothing to an emotional eater  because you don't eat because you are hungry.  Keep in mind the following:


 Diets can work but because we know so little about ourselves and our relationship with food, it makes it difficult to win the battle. A lot of us have problems with dieting because we have a problem called ""emotional eating"" we eat to comfort ourselves during difficult, stressful, sad, etc times in our lives.

You may experience all those emotions during dieting as we continuously get on the scale hoping to see a big difference in numbers after dieting only for a day or two. Also what is stressful when dieting is that we try to lose a large number of weight in such a short period of time which in most cases is unreasonable. 

This all brings about stress, discomfort and sadness. When we feel this way, we turn to our best friend for help and support which for many of us is food. The diet is now broken and we feel that we can't stick to diets. We then try fad diet after fad diet hoping to lose the original 20 pounds and now we may have as much as 30 pounds to lose because we continue to put on weight as we continue to break these fad diets by binging before starting our next diet. 

Please learn about your relationship with food before your next diet so that you may achieve your goals. To help a little, keep in mind the following:

You already know how to lose weight. You know that if you eat less and exercise more eventually youï¿½ll see the pounds come off. Whatï¿½s getting in your way? Why do you usually regain the weight you lost? The answer to all these questions is the same ï¿½Emotional Eating.ï¿½ Simply defined, emotional eating means you eat to satisfy emotional hunger; it means you use food for comfort or as a way to cope with life; and it means you eat for reasons other than what your body needs. Whenever you reach for a boredom-breaking snack despite your commitment, or whenever you eat to quell anxiety, thatï¿½s emotional eating. Whenever you binge after a fight, or double up on portions because your day turned sour, thatï¿½s emotional eating. Whenever you feel that sharp craving for your favorite food, thatï¿½s emotional eating. When we eat during these times while on a diet, we believe the diet doesnï¿½t work or that we lack self control and then look for the quickest way to lose weight (fasting/diet pills, ect) after eating all we can since we already messed the diet day up. Read the information below but remember that emotional eating plays a big part in why we donï¿½t continue dieting and why we regain lost weight and why we binge today and start a new diet tomorrow. Best of Luck.

P.S. After learning about my relationship with food, I was able to drop my weight from 263 pounds down to 151 pounds which is a 112 pound weight lost.",eating problem,,,,"I have an eating problem, I know that i have ben stressed out lately and I seem to be self medicating with food, most of all I dont want to admit that it is related to stress and so I just associate my eating habits with a growing appeite.",eating problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,So I am asking does anyone know of a diet pill that surpresses my  appeite and reduce stress level?

TCM theory has treatment for things like sinusitis, sciatica, neuralgia and even neuralgia.  And 5-element theory treats mental dis-ease very well too.
A mainland China trained physician has had 7 years of university education behind them.  Why can they not practice within the NHS?  Even if they are a member of the Acupuncture trade bodies it still is not enough.  At the same time they are allowed to practice in private practices and are only available to those that can afford it. 
So the question, is why does the NHS not accept a Chinese university education to practice on NHS?  There is a whole range of conditions that even the World Health organization recognizes as effectively treatable with TCm","Yes, it's ridiculous.

I was a blood donor but had acupuncture from a Chinese doctor who, although being qualified to practice this far more than any British doctors, did not have NHS authentication.  He used fresh needles each time and I watched each one being unwrapped and inserted.  But because he didn't have a certain licence issued by the NHS, I am no longer allowed to give blood!  With all the problems with aids and shared needles, did those powers that be seriously think that I would let someone stick used needles in me....the mind boggles

I would go for TCM over NHS any day....if I could afford to.",acupuncture,,,,,,,,,,Even if they are a member of the Acupuncture trade bodies it still is not enough.,still is not enough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"So the question, is why does the NHS not accept a Chinese university education to practice on NHS?",,,,,,No,,,
67,1915882,what are the best ways to prevent shoulder injuries?,"I've been doing bench presses, incline presses, shoulder presses, and lat pulls, all of which work my shoulders.  I've noticed that my left shoulder in particular has been making popping sounds during the incline press in particular.  Am I doing something wrong?  Any specific stretches I can do?  Is it just overexertion?  The last thing I want to do is hurt myself when I'm trying to stay fit.

Thanks :)","Most commonly what you are experiencing is some slight swelling in your biceps muscle, causing it slip over a spot in the upper arm bone (humerus). Couple things you can do to help. Make sure you are always stretching well before and after weights, ice and Advil for any pain, and make sure you are not overtraining or using incoreect mechanics. It probably won't go away, but if it gets any worse you may need to back off the harder shoulder work and use less weight. It's pretty hard to prevent shoulder injuries b/c it is used so often for many different purposes. Good luck.",shoulder injuries,,,,,,,,I've noticed that my left shoulder in particular has been making popping sounds during the incline press in particular.,my left shoulder in particular has been making popping sounds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,what are the best ways to prevent shoulder injuries?,,,,,,No,,,

He seems to ignore the world around him, he seldom speaks just babbles but it is not that he does not know how to speak - it depends on his mood and sometrimes he just utters one or 2 words. He is 4 year. What's the pronosis? What's the best treatment possible for him? He does not make eye contact, rarely responds to people and always seems to be engrossed in his own world.","Asperger's Syndrome is a condition similar to autism, and the educational approaches work working with both are often similar. About the prognosis, I would say that it is often good, so don't despair! People with Asperger's Syndrome have won nobel prizes (Vernon Smith), become famous actors (Dan Ackroyd), or become successful computer programmers, scientists, etc.

To help your friend's child maximize his potential, I would recommend the following educational approaches. Since every child is different, these may or may not apply to your situation or work for you. I would encourage you to keep trying and find a system that works for you friend and their family. She may have already done so, but I would also recommend keeping in close contact with the child's teacher and school to make sure that he  is getting the support needed. Hope this helps! 

- Recognize your child's strengths and interests and use these as opportunities for education (for example, if your child is very interested in Star Wars, you can teach math problems about Star Wars, make cleaning up into a game about Jedi powers, etc.) You never know when an interest may turn into a possible career option for the future (I recently read a book written by a man with Asperger's who made his childhood interest in ""The Wizard of Oz"" into seveal job opportunities! [""Demystifying the Autistic Experience"" by William Stillman""]) (Source #1)

- People with autism/Asperger's are often visual learners and learn well with pictures, charts, step-by-step written instructions, etc. (Source #1)

- Consider reading books by authors with Autism/Asperger's (while these are often geared towards adults, I think they offer valuable information) Authors to consider include Temple Grandin, Edgar R. Schneider, Jerry Newport, Stephen Shore, and William Stillman (Source #1)

- I would also advise you to often require him to look at your or participate in some activity with you. Just anything so that he is engaged with you. If he does not respond, you could repeat your instruction, wait, then (if necessary) gently prompt him physically to give you a high-five by touching your hand to his or something like this. Then, when he does it, reinforce this behavior with lots of praise and perhaps a small portion of a favorite snack or something else he likes. It is importnat that he is engaged with a person or an activity (such as reading or a puzzle, etc) on a somewhat frequent basis. That being said, he also will most likely need some time where he is allowed to relax and ""be engrossed in his own world."" You may also want to develop a system where he can say one word or hand you a card with the word ""break"" written on it so that he can tell you when he is feeling overwhelmed and needs a break from the situation or activity. (Source #1)

- To motivate him to use language, you could, for example if you know he wants juice, don't just give it to him becuase you know that's what he wants. Have him say, ""juice,"" or if he is not ready for that yet, just the first sound of the word before you give him any juice. Gradually, very slowly, require him to say additional words such as, ""want juice,"" then ""want juice please,"" then ""I want juice please, etc."" before you give him the juice. Start with him requesting with one word for most of the things he wants, before starting to require sentences. (Source #1)

- ""Many children with autism are good at drawing, art and computer programming. These talent areas should be encouraged. I think there needs to be much more emphasis on developing the child's talents. Talents can be turned into skills that can be used for future employment."" (Source #2)

I thought about the BP, but since the lightheadedness remains a constant, I don't think this is the reason for it - hence the not mentioning it.  I ""feel"" that it's in my blood - sounds crazy, but true.  As for the anemia, I have normal iron levels - just a bit low RBC.  Hemocrit/Hemoglobin normal (low normal).  Another concern is my Bun & Creatinine levels rose during this blood work.  They've always been pretty constant & now they are higher than I've had, BUT AGAIN, STILL WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGES.  I've read that 1) RBC - low can cause lightheadedness, but again, docs need to get to the underlying cause of the low RBC & since I do not ""lose blood"" on a monthly basis anymore, the chances of me being iron-deficient anemic are quite low.  
2) Kidney disease can cause lightheadedness.  I really am fearful of this because Mom was diabetic & ended up with renal failure due to that.  I am NOT DIABET","Why do you think you can't be anemic just because you  are postmenopausal?  Bleeding and anemia can be caused by lots of things including slow internal bleeding.  It could be from an ulcer, esophageal erosion, it could be from the lower GI tract or all kinds of possibilities.  Since your blood levels are off some you need to talk to your doctor about this and see if he thinks this warrents further investigation or not.  As for the lightheadedness you need to see the doc and get this looked into further.  Since it is a problem for you don't rest until the doc figures out what is going on.  As for kidney diseas this is something your doc can check for.  Because your mom was diabetic you are at a little greater risk of developing it which I realize you are aware of.

18,3496036,I am suffering from generalized gingival recession and sensitivity. How long will my teeth last?,"I want to know from experience what is the period like for tooth loss to happen if good care is given like flossing and two time brushing. I am 28-year-old male and a smoker of 20 ciggs a day(i know quitting will reduce risk). Also sometimes I clench my teeth at night. I want to know exact reasons of recession - whther it is too much brushing, bruxism (clenching of teeth - nightguard needed and how to measure bruxism?), alchohal, plaque deposits or anything else? and if I reduce all risks how long will it take for tooth loss to happen? currently I have almsot 4-5 mm of recession on outer side of all teeth while no recession at all on inside of teeth except for lower front teeth (which are mis-aligned and thus gather more plaque). Dental x-rays show very minimal bone less. how you reduced risk? Whether gum grafting is successful as I am very concerned about this condition and fear immediate tooth loss if recession goes on at this rate(i have noticed recession only 6 months back).","As a dental hygienist of six years and now a dentist, I must tell you, no one can answer this question with out seeing you.  Not only can you see recession but you must do a periodontal exam to evaluate the bone levels, if you have pockets, you have lost more bone than you know (add recession+pocket depth= total loss of supporting structure).  I recommend, #1 see a dentist for a comprehensive exam and voice your concerns. #2 QUIT SMOKING (it increases your risk of periodontal disease). #3 Keep up with regual dental visits (often people with gum disease need to have cleanings and maintianance every 3-4 months). In most cases, someone as young as you are who practices good home care can reverse some of the loss or at least halt the disease in which case you could keep your teeth your entire life.  Recession can be caused by many of the things you mentioned, aggressive/improper bruhsing, brusxism, plaque and calculus (tartar) depostits.

I'm having trouble concentrating on things, feel as though everything i have ever worked for and people i love are going to abandon me because i'm not good enough for them. There is a constant fear of them not liking me anymore. I've noticed that i feel alot more attatched to inanimate objects. I also have serious self-confidence issues. i don't know the situation i am in, and if desired i can tell more of how i am feeling.(i feel selfish saying that).if anyone is a phycologist, then i would appreciate your insight.","I'm not a psychologist, but I am a social worker. You do sound like you may have some depression and/or anxiety issues. The good thing is that you have already started the road to recovery by reaching out for help. Both depression and anxiety are very curable. I have had both of these, and counseling really helped me. 

Please know that when you are feeling like this is part of being down, and that things can get better. Your fears of not being good enough are very common to people who are depressed and people in general! I don't think there are many people who have not privately felt that they are not ""good enough"".  Self confidence can be learned. In the meantime, be gentle to yourself - you deserve it. 

You sound like you could benefit from going to counseling. There are many ways to do this. You can get a referral from a community information center or 211 if there is a 211 line in your area. If you do not have benefits at work, there are some non-profit agencies if money is an issue. Some faith communities have trained counselors as well.  If you have a good relationship with your family doctor, you could also talk to them about this and see if they have some referrals. I benefitted a lot from a book called Feeling Good by David Burns which should be in most major bookstores and libraries. Of course, there are many books that you might find helpful.

This type of breast cancer starts in the milk ducts and spreads to the skin of the nipple and areola (the dark circle around the nipple). The nipple and areola will often appear crusted, scaly and red. The patient may experience burning, itching or notice some bloody discharge from the nipple.

Paget's Disease is a rare form of breast cancer, occurring in only 1% of all cases. It can be associated with in situ carcinoma as well as invasive carcinoma. If no lump can be felt in the breast tissue and the biopsy shows the growth to be in situ and not invasive, treatment for Paget's Disease is very effective.""

29,768616,is wearing flip flops healthy for feet or not? please see my details?,"Hi. Like most girls at 17 I love wearing flip flops all the time but many articles say they are bad for your feet. I don't get it.

The anti-flipflop articles say that b/c flip flops lack arch support your feet may get fallen arches. However many websites that encourage bare feet (which I also do a lot but only indoors) say that going barefoot can HELP strengthen your feet and develop good arches.

See the contradiction? Going barefoot and flip flops both have no arch support but barefoot can ""tone your feet"" and flip flops will ""cause fallen arches"". It makes no sense. I think flip flops is the closest you can get to natural barefoot walking without dirty feet and risk injury/infection. Can someone explain? Thanks!

And more importantly, how do I correct the imbalance? drinking more water seems logical for the bloating, but drinking more fluid of ANY kind (even pedialyte) just makes me LOADS worse much faster! Is there a supplement or medication I need? Should I fast? Please help!","Are you under the care of a nutritionalist?  or dietician? you probably should be.  They can help alot with different food plans to help you.

You're not used to eating and you have to start all over like a baby.  Start with a spoon of food, soft food, maybe oatmeal, every 2 hours, and slowly work up to a larger portion.  Eat just soft foods that are easy to digest.  Your electrolyte and hormones are probably way out of sync due to malnutrition so until you are able to eat better, you may have the mood swings and all.  You need to have potassium, maybe mash up or try to eat some bananas.  The bloating is because your body is storing gases and is not used to eating.  You just need to take it slow with small bites much like a baby when they are starting to eat solids.  Drink sips of water, don't try to swig down a glass.  Try an ounce or two with each spoonful of food.  Vary it, use fruit juices too instead of just water.  

I had a friend who went through what you are going through.  It took her about 2-3 weeks of eating a spoonful here or there, with the small amounts of liquids to get up to a full meal.  Soup and broths are good to use too.",Eating Disorder Recovery,,,,,,,,I am recovering from bulimia and my entire body and digestive system are totally damaged and out of whack.,bulimia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"can ANYONE tell me what is causing this, and why stopping bulimia results in such terrible symptoms?",,,,,,Not applicable,,,

I had sex on the morning of the 6th. since then I have been feeling some pregnancy symptoms, which i guess could also be pms stuff too. but i have never had these kind of things happen to me in pms. Like breast tenderness and fullness, exhaustion in the afternoon, even if i haven't done much all day, mild headaches, and also some nausea but not to the point that I would have to go to the bathroom. 
So could I be pregnant or is it just pms?","If you have any of these pregnancy symptoms, and have missed your period be sure to take an at home pregnancy test, it is almost certain that you are pregnant!! 

A missed menstrual cycle can be a sign of pregnancy. It is usually the first indicator of pregnancy, although some women claim to know they are pregnant before they miss a period, since your period is not yet due, you should take the other points into consideration;

Tender swollen breasts are another early symptom. While tender breasts are a symptom of an impending menstrual cycle, swollen breasts are not. Sore and swollen breasts with a tingling sensation can be an early indicator of pregnancy;

Fatigue can be another indicator of pregnancy, especially if other symptoms are present. A nap a day can help a pregnant woman maintain normal daily activities.

It seems that you are experiencing most of these symptoms and only the missed period has not been experienced, simply because the date of your next period has not been reached.

Conclusively ( I am no Doctor) I would put some stakes on 'you are pregnant'(I am no gambler either.

57,1752930,Was I pregnant?,"Right after I had my period and i was supposed to start the pill, i forgot and took it a day late. that night I had unprotected sex, and a few days later i had symptoms of pregnancy, such as vomiting every day and breast tenderness, although no cramps or pains(which I don't even get when I have my period. I was going to wait to see if I got my period, which i did, but I know when you are on the pill, it is still possible to get your period. About 2 weeks later I started bleeding, but not heavy like when I have my period. After 2 weeks of bleeding I took a pregnancy test, and it came up negative. So I'm wondering if I was pregnant and I had a miscarriage? I never went to the doctor, but It's been a month since that, so should I go to the doctor, or is there no point now since it's been a month? If it was a miscarriage and if there is no way for the doctor to tell because it's been so long, would it affect me in the future when I want to have kids?","well for one thing you dont have symptoms for a few weeks after the egg implants itself. and that can take up to 12 days. then a week or 2 later you start to exerience breast tenderness. you were never pregnant. these symptoms could just be all in your head or its side effects of the pill. if you are vomiting you need to go to a lower dose while on the pill
you got yout period
and you dont experience symptoms till about 2 weeks after the egg implants itself. 

but if you didnt think you had a miscarriage then you should go tot he doc to see if anythign is left in there that could cause an infection that could lead to infertlity. but to me it just sounds like its side effects of the pill (if you are a few months new to it, your body is still adjusting, nausea, vomiting and breat tnderness are all side effects of the pill if you read the pamphlet.) never have unprotected sex either! the pill is not 100% effective and since you seem to not take them everyday then there is a decrease in effeciency of the pill protecting against pregnany. im on the pill and take it on time everyday and still use condoms even though i dont have to worry about std's cause we both lost ours to eachother, but we always use condoms just to protect against pregnancy just incase the condoms break the pill is really a back up method. 

go tot he doctor if you are still concerned. im sure you can talk tot he nurse and just get the answer over the phone but please prtect yourself! 

it is also if you are new to the pill that you bleed between periods. the symptoms of a miscarriage is heavy heavy bleeedin and severe cramps. 

liek i said its mostly side effects of the pill and you should talk to your doc abotu getting a lower dose of the pill",pregnant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I never went to the doctor, but It's been a month since that, so should I go to the doctor, or is there no point now since it's been a month?",miscarriage,,,,,So I'm wondering if I was pregnant and I had a miscarriage?,,,,,,Not applicable,,,

63,2834243,What is the best way to deal with mild to moderate depression that doesn't deal with anti-depresants(MAOI)?,"I have struggled with bouts of depression and isolation for as long as I can remember. I have seen the adverse affects of anti-depresants on my father and the way that he continued to struggle. I am a single man in my early 20's, who attends a university, and works for nearly everything he gets. I feel that there is always something missing and I;m getting tired of trying unsuccessfully to discover what it is. I have tried spirituality and I'm very active in my church but I feel unsatisfied. I have read extensively about depression and seasonal affective disorders and have come across too much information on the subject. I need the advice of you, the person reading this at this time. If you have suffered the affects of depression and have overcome without the use of perscription drugs-please tell me how you did it, or useful resourses that might help me. Thank you.","I understand your desire to stay away from ""sledgehammer"" solutions. When it comes to your health, remedies that are stronger are not always better. I have three things that have gotten me through times when I've been depressed, and they're all gentle solutions that I think will suit an intelligent person like yourself. 

1 - The first is what Freud calls the ""talking cure"". He insists that it must be performed by a psychoanalyst who you are paying for, but actually I've performed it by writing in a diary. The key is to be very honest, and try to find connections that you might otherwise be supressing, because these are the areas that need work. For example, what's the first thing that pops into your mind when you think of ""depression""? If the answer is ""flying a kite"", then follow the chain... What do you think of when you think of ""kite"" and ""flying""... You'll be surprised how quickly this takes you right down to an event in your childhood or an unresolved conflict that might have happened a year ago.

2 - Looking for lies. A chair cannot make you depressed. A lampshade cannot make you depressed. Only another person can make you depressed. I believe it is because a chair and a lampshade cannot lie. Only a person can lie. Depression, it seems to me, comes from believing a lie. That conflict (between reality and the lie) takes up so much mental energy to maintain, it drains you as a whole. You may find, after using technique #1, that it leads to you to this conclusion #2. For example, after free associating your way to an event, you might find that it was when someone told you that you weren't worth a hill of beans. The problem is not that they insulted you, the problem is that you believed the lie. Beware, giving up on a lie that we've believed in for a long time is tougher than it sounds.

3 - This one is going to sound goofy, especially after wading in deeply with the other two techniques. Get some light to shine on the cells in the back of your eyes. Go outside for an extended period of time without sunglasses (no need to stare at the sun or a light-bulb, indirect light will do). Use one of those gentle light therapy products like www.everlyte.com . Take a trip on a sailboat. Spend a few hours in open fields on sunny days. It's those cells in the eyes that produce much of the chemical that those pills seek to replace.",depression,,,,I have struggled with bouts of depression and isolation for as long as I can remember.,depression and isolation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,What is the best way to deal with mild to moderate depression that doesn't deal with anti-depresants(MAOI)?,,,,,,Not applicable,,,

I have alot more experience with strep than I could ever want, so I hope this helps.  OH, P.S. If you want to feel better faster, getting the shot of penicillin works alot faster than the pills.

When inserting the dye they need a good vein you must not have them,,  Join the club.  I always have trouble even when I have a simple blood test taken.

Based on a study conducted on the various types of oregano, it was determined that these herbs were able to kill bacteria due to the heavy content of phenolic substances found in their cellular structure. 

Oregano, by connecting the free radicals released from the cells within its contents, is very healthy and improves the body's cell protection system. 

Oregano prevents the formation of cancer and diabetes and regulates the level of cholesterol. This characteristic prevents tumors and slows ageing of cells. 

Natural protector: 

As we all know, many additives are used to protect food against spoiling. Although scientists believe these chemical additives have no adverse effects on humans when used properly in correct amounts, they still recommend using natural preservatives. This is where oregano comes in. It is even possible to say the miracle of oregano is that, as a natural food preserver, it eliminates the adverse effects and risks that chemical additives have. 

For Warts or Boils: Saturate affected area(s). Cover with a bandage. Repeat dressing until lesions are clear.

NOTE:Oil of Oregano can also be taken internally.

That's why they can be so darn scary. But it's better to go to the hospital just to be sure. They would rather see you there with a panic attack than to have you second-guess and be wrong. Are you male or female? Often doctors don't take female symptoms as seriously because they think only men get heart disease. If you wake up in the middle of the night trying to catch your breath, you may have sleep apnea. That's when you stop breathing for several seconds and up to a minute. This can cause heart problems. So talk to your doctor about testing at a sleep clinic. (Do you snore?? That often accompanies sleep apnea.) I know it's frustrating to go to the doctor so often and to find nothing wrong. To learn more about panic attacks, go to the link below. You can also do a search on sleep apnea. If you think it could be panic attacks, there are medications you can take to control them... the SSRI class of medications. Talk to your doctor, or better, to a psychiatrist. That's a medical doctor with special training in emotional issues. They can diagnose conditions and prescribe appropriate medications. Good luck.

if you need any additional details plz ask but help me. doctors here in pakistan are pathetic i can't go for an ultrasound or blood test again & again...",You could be pregnant but then again there is always the chance that the home test was wrong.  They will give you false positives but almost never give you false negative answers.  Your period being late could have been from many things.  Stress being the most common factor.  The abdominal pain could be cramps that as associated with the menstral cycle. If the doctors test and the blood test say negative wait for a couple of days and then try another home test and see what it says.  Now as far as the sickness and tender breasts a lot of girls get that with their period.  The dizziness sometimes comes along with  a period because of the blood loss during that time.  Now the contipation i have no idea what to tell you about that.

25,1716638,Is Gluten related to acne and depression (or other mental disorders)?,"After living in Korea for a few years, I returned to Canada. Within a few months bad acne started to appear on my back, and my energy levels became sluggish. 
In Korea, I ate a typical Korean diet consisting of rice, tons of veggies, sushi, no cooked meat, and very rarely ate bread. 
Upon returning to Canada, I was excited to eat sandwiches, and subs. So my diet is basically the same now, except the bread.
I know there is a connection. What other effects can Gluten have on people's general overall health?","Diet is o_ne of the most controversial areas of discussion when it comes to the topic of health in the modern age. Biological studies suggest that there is a direct link between acne and diet. In fact, some researchers say a poor diet is responsible for up to 90% of all acne-related cases. Unfortunately, when it comes to diet everyone's dietary needs and tolerances to different foods are different.

You should make sure that you avoid any foods you are allergic to. Testing is available at allergy specialists' offices to find out which foods you are either intolerant or allergic to. If this is not an option the best way to see if a particular food is causing or aggrevating your acne is to go o_n an elimination diet. By o_nly following a detox diet, you can't really see which foods your skin tolerates or not because the diet is so restrictive. I think a better way and easier way in the long term is to pick o_ne possible acne-causing food group and eliminate it from your diet for a couple of months to see if there is any improvement. For example, you can start with dairy foods...you continue to eat your normal diet but you eliminate all dairy for two months. If it works, great, if not then you can reintroduce dairy and pick another food group like high glycemic/refined carbohydrates...you do the same thing and see if it helps. As a normal rule the basic potentially acne-causing foods to test out are: dairy, carbs, high fat/fried foods, copper-rich foods and iodine-rich foods. By eliminating o_ne at a time, it will be much easier to follow than eating o_nly fruits nuts and veggies.

These following diets have been popular, and have proved successful in clearing acne for many acne sufferers.

Diet 1 - Dairy Free: No dairy, that means no cowï¿½s milk or any of the foods that are derived from cowï¿½s milk such as: cheese, yogurt, lactose, or dairy whey ext. Dairy foods contain many different drugs and hormones that come from the cowï¿½s body. Cows are fed grain with antibiotics added to the grain to prevent the cows from getting cow diseases such as mastitis. Mastitis is an inflammation of the cows udders. Antibiotics fed to cows pass into the milk, and milk products that we consume. These added antibiotics to our diets through consumption of dairy foods can cause some of us other physical problems as well as aggravate acne. Some researchers believe that feeding so many antibiotics to food animals can make diseases that people get become antibiotic resistant. Cows are fed hormones to increase their milk production. Women are especially affected by ingesting milk products from animals that have been fed hormones as supplements. Many people are also intolerant to the lactose in dairy. Lactose is milk sugar. This intolerance can induce diarrhea in some individuals.

Diet 2 - Gluten Free: Eliminate all gluten containing food products, which include Wheat, Barley, Rye and others. Around 30% of people have been shown to be intolerant to gluten to some degree. This intolerance creates digestive problems which creates inflammation in the gut. The inflammation that is created is a cause of acne in persons who have this particular digestive problem. Many chronic diseases are initially caused by various food intolerances such as the gluten intolerance so by eliminating this problem you eliminate a cause of acne, and you also eliminate a cause of possible future disease.

Diet 3 - Lectin Free: Lectins are sugar-binding proteins that mimic insulin. They bind to carbohydrates, and to various proteins. This binding action causes your body to attack itself, which in turn creates inflammation. This inflammation leads to more acne, among many other physiological problems. The Lectin-Free diet restricts things like grains, nightshades (ie. peppers, tomatoes, potatoes), legumes (ie. beans) and some starches.

40,2167572,Sit ups causing severe stomach pains.?,"I have been trying to do sit ups, but it is hurting when I do.  I can do other stomach flattening excercises with no problems, and I can do many reps, 30 or more depending on what I am doing.  My back is fine, nothing else hurts.

As much as I try, I can not get one out of the way, the pain is unbearable, and I have a high tolerance for pain.  It will also be quite painful in my stomach when I try to stand straight for a few minutes afterwards.

She must be as worried as you are, but the less stress she has to deal with the better. Give her as much support and understanding as you can.
This does sound like epiepsy and not a mental illness, I don't know why people have said that. It can make her 'spaced out' and unaware of her surroundings, and hear sounds and voices, and smell odd smells; especially just before she has a fit.
I can't imagine what all this feels like from her point of view but she must be aware that her friends don't go through this. Its tough and very unfair on you both. At least you are aware there's a problem and are getting her help.
When you go to the hospital take a pen and paper and write things down, when they are telling you a lot of stuff it gets difficult to remember. Ask them to spell things if you don't know how. If the consultant can't speak to you in plain english just keep asking ""what does that mean in laymans tems"" until you get a straight answer. Ask for leaflets and support groups.
And also don't forget that you will need support too.

Viral encephalitis is indeed a disease of the central nervous system and during the course of the disease, the brain tissue in various locations maybe have been compromised...think of a cerebral vascular accident-a stroke-where blood flow has been interrupted to one area of the brain...the area of the body then becomes affected by something that happened in the brain. Fevers do the same thing as the foci of the infection has affected a specific area.

About 1 week ago, I had my second outbreak.  This time much much less severe.  It was only a small bump on the vaginal lip and was gone within 4-5 days.  I know it was a herpes outbreak because I went to the doctor.  Now, I have several small clustered bumps on my inner thigh, that release clear liquid and itch.  I don't know where that came from.  I have not had sexual intercourse between the two outbreaks.  My questions are this:

1. I know that herpes is contagious, but is it contagious within your own body?  Meaning, if I touched the sore that was on the vaginal lip, and then touched my inner thigh, is my thigh now infected with the virus?

2.  Can an outbreak be so close together?  It was only a week ago that I had my second outbreak.  

Please help, serious answers only please.  

Thanks a lot!","The Herpes virus causes both the outbreak that you can get on your genitals, and also is the cause of coldsores that you get around your mouth (although I've heard that if you have one, you cannot get the other). It is incurable (unfortunatly) but for most people, outbreaks are rare, and in some cases after the initial outbreak, they never have another (although they still carry the virus). It an be transmitted from area to area both on your own body and from person to person. Again in some cases, outbreaks will clear up on their own without any medication, however if an outbreak is severe, or doens't go away you should see your doctor. Your thigh is infected with the virus and outbreaks can be close together. In the same way as coldsores, outbreaks tend to happen when you are stressed or feeling under the weather as your immune system isn't at top levels. To help prevent further outbreaks keep your vitamin intake high, especially vit. C by eating lots of fresh, uncooked fruit and veg and drinking lots of OJ. You will always carry the virus (unless they find a cure) so always use a condom when having sex to prevent further infection to other people and always wash your hands after touching an infected area to prevent further infection on yourself. Also, if the doctor didn't already do it, get checked out for other STDs. Ones like Chlamydia often have no symptoms but can casue infertility and if yuo have Herpes, you may have other STDs.",herpes,,Female,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I don't know where that came from.,I have not had sexual intercourse,,,,,is it contagious within your own body?

I become obsessed with a book, television show, or person.

They can be very short (just a few days to a week) or rather long (months to a year).

The obsessions with people are the ones that worry me; I've had one of those before, and it wasn't mutual.

NOW my son is going through this and he is in the 3rd grade. I just cant even stand this. I have gone to the teachers and they say that he is fine and no one messes with him.

""Paget's Disease of the Nipple

This type of breast cancer starts in the milk ducts and spreads to the skin of the nipple and areola (the dark circle around the nipple). The nipple and areola will often appear crusted, scaly and red. The patient may experience burning, itching or notice some bloody discharge from the nipple.

Paget's Disease is a rare form of breast cancer, occurring in only 1% of all cases. It can be associated with in situ carcinoma as well as invasive carcinoma. If no lump can be felt in the breast tissue and the biopsy shows the growth to be in situ and not invasive, treatment for Paget's Disease is very effective.""

I have NO swelling, full range of motion, no discoloration, no prior history of knee problems- ever. There was no ""sudden injury"" - exercise a lot and it started hurting after a long day of working out. The pain is mainly on the inner side of my left knee. I also feel a soreness over my kneecap, but I'm not sure if that's just secondary pain. I'm not taking anti-inflammatories because I'm afraid that they will interfere with the healing process. The pain isn't killing me, but it bothers me and I'm afraid that this isn't going to get better.  I can walk without a limp, but honestly I do feel tenderness and a little pain when I do walk. I have icing the injury 3 times a day and am not sure if I should continue icing my knee since there has never been any visible swelling.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!","It sounds to me as though it is a MCL strain.  If your knee starts to click, give way or lock, there is more of a problem.  Avoid twisting on the knee and going upstairs with it first.

I would start using heat on the area.  This will increase the circulation and the healing to the area.  If at any time you start to feel increased pain with the heat, stop and return to the ice.

Knees are strange creatures.  Even one teaspoon of extra fluid/swelling within the knee joint can stop the thigh muscles working for 3-5 days.  It is virtually impossible to tell if this small amount of swelling is even present - not even an MRI would detect it!

Try using a simple knee brace when you are up and about, even an ACE wrap would help.  This will just give you an extra bit of support, but do not rely upon braces - they can actually make you weaker in the long term.

If things do not calm down in the next 5-7 days, ask your doctor for a referal to a good physical therapist.

This should have been done initially if you suspected an STD which it does sound like. 
Many doctors in this day and age are beginning to decrease the amount of STD tests done, stupid it know, as they believe the STD epidemic is declining as people become more familiar with safe sex.

Back to your question, has this always happend when you have had sex? No? Then something has obviously developed. Either demand further testing from your doctor or give him/her a sample on the spot. Yes I mean go out and obtain a sample of the gunk on a swab. If you tell the doctor before hand they should be able to give you a pathology swab with a special tube to keep it in. 

Another variation on your symptoms is a blockage of the ducts out of the scrotum, this would cause a blockage and swelling of the vessels giving the illusion your right ball is swallon. Once the body acts to right this wrong the semen would ooze out as it is the only place it can go.

Either way you need to see a specialist if your doctor is being complacent about the issue!

Why?  Because this has very little to do with chemicals, it has everything to do with her coping skills.  It is one of psychology's biggest mysteries about how the brain function works.  When you become depressed for example, you begin to create a nerve dysfunction in the brain actually perpetuating the problem.  The symptons cause the probelm if that makes sense.  My point is that if she has never had coping skills, her thinking is always irrational and will cause the problems in her brain.  That's why without learning how to ""cope"" she's not gonna be healthy.  Her biggest issue is that without someone, she will die.  A lot of peole fear this.  It's usually caused by neglect and/or abandonment as a child.  And as an adult, they can not comprehend that they will not die without someone there.

50,249232,Athsma or just out of shape?,"My fiance has asthma and recently we both began exercizing together. After a long hike at a strong pace, she began to complain that her asthma was bothering her. I also have asthma, but it is not excercize induced. So I am wondering if she is really experiencing asthma symptoms or just out-of-breatheness that comes with starting an exercize regimen. 

I myself have had breathing problems after a strenuous workout, but overcame them by getting in shape, so it's difficult for me to gauge whether or not what she is experiencing is asthma.","Features that suggest shortness of breath is due to asthma would include a wheeze when breathing out and a cough that produces mucus.  Since asthma is, by definition, reversible airways obstruction, her symptoms should improve when she takes her blue inhaler (assuming her 'reliever' inhaler is blue).  Next time she exercises she should take her blue 'ventolin/salbutamol' inhaler 20 minutes before exercise to see if that prevents her symptoms from occuring.  Exercise induced asthma is often worse in cold weather, when the person has a cold and at other times, such as when the pollen count is high.

Like eczema and hayfever, many people with purely exercise induced asthma grow out of it.

Maybe she needs to go to her doctor for a review of her asthma status and medication.",Athsma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,I am wondering if she is really experiencing asthma symptoms,,,,,,Not applicable,,,

I was conceived for 3 times and had early miscarriages.
 I dont have inferitility problem,bec., i already have one son and also had miscarriages.
My gyno said my progesterone level is low, and told me to start the medication once i conceive.But its been 4 months after i had my last miscarriage.Its really awfull, but i consoled myself, bec., i dont want the stress to stop me getting pregnant.
Can anybody suggest any way to get me pregnant? Or to increase the progesterone level?","This progesterone level in itself is only a little bit below the optimum for a peak progesterone level. I wonder if there isn't some other reason suggesting low progesterone (or luteal phase insufficiency) such as a short cycle or premenstrual spotting that is pushing your physician in the direction of prescribing Clomid. Without knowing more about your situation, it is hard to know if this is the best intervention for you at this time.

Have you been identifying the peak mucus day for several months, and having intercourse on that day for at least six months? What is the quality of your cervical mucus? Did you have an infection since the birth of your last child that might have caused a tubal blockage or uterine inflammation? Have your thyroid levels been checked? Have you had an ultrasound that might show a polyp or fibroids? Has your husband had a semenalysis? 

With two prior pregnancies, it might be a little soon do a laparoscopy to check for endometriosis or other problems but if infertility persists that might be in order.

Clomid is a legitimate therapy in the medical literature for luteal phase insufficiency as well as lack of ovulation. But it can also cause poor mucus and a thin endometrial lining in some people. A more thorough workup of the luteal phase (the time in the cycle after ovulation) might be helpful in determining the best therapy. At Pope Paul VI Institute, the type of workup for this problem might include THREE determinations of progesterone AND estrogen five, seven and nine days after ovulation (as determined by ovulation predictor kits or peak day in charting). Estrogen levels should be in the range of 110 or 120(or 11 or12 depending on the lab). Progesterone should be at least 12 on peak plus five days, 15 on peak plus 7, and 12 on peak plus nine.

Sometimes progesterone will drop off rapidly nine days after ovulation even though values to that point are optimal. We diagnose a late luteal phase insufficency if the progesterone nine days after the peak drops 50% below the value seven days after the peak. If only one progesterone determination is made,you will not be able to diagnose a luteal phase insufficiency. If you have good mucus and estrogen, there are no other problems, and only progesterone is deficient, my feeling is progesterone vaginal capsules in a 600 mg. dose may be a better therapy. These are available by prescription from Kubat pharmacy in Omaha, Nebraska.

If both estrogen and progesterone are deficient AND you are ovulating, the method most often used at Pope Paul VI is very low dose Clomid (25 mg. day three, four and five of the cycle) followed by HCG injections (2000 units every other day for four doses starting three days after the peak). This is a more complicated therapy, but the low dose of Clomid given earlier in the cycle has less adverse effect on the mucus than standard regimens and is very effective if you are already ovulating and have luteal phase insufficiency of both progesterone and estrogen.",miscarriages,,Female,,"Its really awfull, but i consoled myself, bec., i dont want the stress to stop me getting pregnant.",miscarriages,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Can anybody suggest any way to get me pregnant?,Can anybody suggest any way to get me pregnant?,,,Can anybody suggest any way to get me pregnant?,,Yes: (All examples shared in the response),,,

84,2875349,What does prostate cancer feel like?,"I mean just in terms of general discomfort...  not involving sticking hands up butts and feeling around.

See... I've got this interesting pain just a tiny bit northward of my groinal parts.... a rather inexplicable and temporary pain, but uncomfortable in an amusing sort of way regardless.

I know my family are rather prone to cancer... my mother's father and my own father both having died of it... and since one in three people die of cancer at some point, I wouldn't be surprised if I'd go the same way (unless I voluntarily end myself before that). 

I'm just wondering if pains in that region could indicate cancer at all or whether its just something else. It didn't go away when I went for a p!ss... so its not bladder issues, I imagine... 

Oh.... and no... I'm not going to see a doctor.
If it is cancer, I fully intend to just suffer it out to whatever end it may bring. 
[Note to theists: life is not sacred... its an accident, and is fundamentally worthless, including mine.]","well, even if you DO see a doctor, it's not like he can force you to receive treatment.  i agree with you on the accidental, futile nature of life, but i figure, if i'm alive now, i might as well enjoy it as much as possible and have as fun and fulfilling a life as possible.

so if i were you, i'd go to the doctor.  if it was something easily treatable that wouldn't infringe on my life (such as a daily pill or something), i'd take the treatment.  if i found out it was cancer, i'd just refuse treatment and enjoy the remainder of my life as much as possible.

i'm sure you agree when i say i'd rather have 6 months of good, functional living and then die, as opposed to spending 5 years on chemo, and finally dying miserably.

85,2964508,"why is my 3.5 year old giving me so problems with eating lately, and why the sudden temper tantrums?","she has recently been giving me a really hard time when it comes to eating. normally, she eats A LOT! it used to blow me away at the amount of food she could consume in a day, now i'm lucky if i get 1 meal a day in her. i know kids will eat when they are hungry, but it seems that she just isn't hungry. this has been an issue for the last 2 weeks. also, she has NEVER thrown a tantrum, until last night. she threw such a fit, and got so upset, and screamed so much, that she made herself cough until she threw up...3 times! what's the deal here?","Wow. The first thing I would check is her interaction with people over the past couple weeks. Is she in Daycare? Does she have a play pal she's spending a lot of time with? Does she have a caregiver at home if you work outside the home?

Sometimes kids at that age have observed another person behaving in a particular way in order to obtain the desired result 
(ie. a tantrum that gets a child an ice cream or toy they want). She might be trying out this new negotiation technique.

Another thing about 3 1/2, they are learning a zillion new things each day and their little heads are full, full, full. Imagine if you worked in an office and you had 20 projects you needed to complete and your boss came in and dumped a huge stack of stuff in your inbox and said, "" I need this ASAP"". You might grumble after the boss leaves, but a three year old faced with a proportionally simliar moment will fling themselevs onto the floor and scream and cry until all the bad stuff goes away.

Try simplifying her schedule for a couple of days and try going on a food field trip to the grocery store. Take your time and show her all the pretty produce and things she might like and get a cheap little notebook to carry around to write down the list of all the things she likes. Then when you do your shopping, you can get a few things off her favorite list each time so she has some say in what goes into her tummy. You could go through magazines and cut out pictures of food or use the google image option and make her a ""Menu"" like she's got her own restaurant. You can split it up in pages of breakfast, lunch and dinner and special snacks. She can go through the picture book and select what she will eat and then you can show her how to spell that word and maybe how to make the food item (like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich)

Both of my kids went through the ridiculously picky eater stage about that age. They will survive! My son is 6'2"" and a college rower and my daughter is 5'10"" and a volleyball player and coach.

Temper tantrum solution: This is weird but IT WORKS. When kids are out of control, it scares them as much as it scares you.
Get an ice cold cup of water and very calmly tell her to take a sip and calm down. If she won;t, tell her she can drink it or wear it. If she continues to flail and scream ( and I know this sounds bizzare) toss the water right in her face. She will come to a complete stop and you will have her full attention.

Go and get another cup of ice cold water and ask her if she is now ready to have a sip of water. She will drink it- trust me. And the cold and sipping motion will calm her down enough to regain control of her self.

I only had to do this ONE TIME with my kids. Any time I saw a tantrum coming from then on, I would ask them if they needed a glass of water and they would calm down and even go get themselves a cup.

Its now left me emotiional because it says the injection is needed within 72 hours of miscarriage.  Why didnt the doctor tell me about this and why is  there no concern  ...I dont know who to seek advise from because my gp doesnt seem concerned about me miscarrying but it is beginning to leave me really depressed because me and my partner so much want to be proud parents x,"Hi Maria,

Firstly let me say how sorry I am for your losses. My husband and I have had two miscarriages in the last year and so totally sympathise with how you are feeling.

The advice your friend has given you is completely incorrect. You blood never mixes with the baby's so there is no chance of this kind of reaction occuring. NHS policy usually waits for three miscarriages until the doctor recommends some kind of investigation be done. You are free to chose your own GP and I would recommend that you find a new one!

Very often we don't know why miscarriages take place, and although I know this is of no comfort to you, please at least be assured that it is nothing that you have done that has caused this.

The miscarriage association as a confidential help line which you can call if you need to talk to someone. You can also ring NHS Direct and speak to a nurse there.

I would also look in to adopting. I know many couples who have had problems either concieving or carring a child to term. They have adopted and then have concieved naturally! By adopting you may allow a child that would have been aborted the chance of life.

You and your partner will remain in our prayers (if that is ok).",miscarriages,,Female,,This has left me devastated and left me looking for the reason why this keeps happening. / Its now left me emotiional /  it is beginning to leave me really depressed,miscarriages / they did not give me the injection / miscarriages,,,,,It has now left me angry / Why didnt the doctor tell me about this and why is  there no concern,they know im 0- and they did not give me the injection,,,,,,,,,confused,they know im 0- and they did not give me the injection,,,,,I dont know who to seek advise from,i recently had my 3rd miscarriage.,,,I dont know who to seek advise from,,"Yes: Firstly let me say how sorry I am for your losses.

While it sounds nice, be a protective mama bear and watch over your little cub.  I used to tell people that I'm a very peaceful person unless someone messes with my children.  Then, I'm a mama bear and you just messed with my cubs!

Keep her close.  She may be disappointed now, but someday she will understand how much you love her.

People accused me of keepng my daughters too close and sheltering them.  Well.... they are now young adult women.  We have had no smoking, no drinking, no drugs, no premarital sex (older daughter was a virgin on her wedding night).  Seems to me that I did a pretty good job.

As they got older I talked to them a lot about life.  They learned what to say to boys, to have self-respect, and to take care of themselves.  

So to the nay-sayers who think we should let our kids run the streets nowadays..... I point to the kids who've died in the streets, been molested, abused, etc.  None of that happened to my kids, so they should just back up off of it.

18,1937227,Help! BV or Yeast infection???,I've had this reocurring yeast infection or bv infection it seems to come after every second period i've tried switching tampons didn't work. I've been with the same sex partner for 7 years and were both very clean. i've tried canestine it helped the symptoms but took a while to go away but keeps comming back.. the discharge is a pinkish colour sometimes just white and thick it doesent have a fishy odour but sometimes it does smell weird its very itchy sometimes its not and it burns  its very irritating..I've been tested for everything i told the doctor about it my last pap test and nothing showed up and i would like to figure this out its been years and i would like to have a normal sex life :( please help if you know the answer!,"First of all I feel your pain, I used to have constant bacterial vaginosis and yeast infections during my teens however when I switched from commercial tampons and commercial pads to a silicone menstrual cup my infections stopped  from constant infections for 7 years to not a single infection in 3-4 years now. I looked into it more, also into more general menstrual and vaginal information to find out why this was a problem for me, and now I'm a menstrual activist and study gynaecology.


During menstruation you of course release menstrual blood into your vagina, this menstrual blood is a different pH to that of the naturally acidic environment of the vagina and as such the differing pH can affect the normal vaginal flora  thus also why you should not use anything but plain water to wash with, any sort of chemicals can interfere with that pH and lead to infections. The risk of infection during menstruation alone is not common unless you already have an imbalance in your vaginal pH, the change in pH from menstrual blood furthers the problem and menstrual blood is nutritious so bacteria love the stuff. 


Stop using tampons is my immediate thought, particularly commercial tampons such as Tampax, are the most harmful of all menstrual options, they prevent your vagina from cleaning itself, give bacteria a place to multiply, leave fibres within the vagina, put chemicals into the vagina that affect vaginal pH so in turn affect vaginal flora, dry out mucosa leading to vaginal splitting, and various other problems are caused from tampon use. This is why tampons are so strongly linked with vaginal infections and toxic shock syndrome, as well as other vaginal and menstrual health problems.

If you prefer internal menstrual options to external menstrual options such as pads or free-flow then I would highly suggest using a menstrual cup, these are cups that are either bell-shaped or diaphragm-shaped and made from medical grade silicone, rubber or plastic depending on the brand. Menstrual cups have no health risks associated what-so-ever and unlike tampons they are also hygienic, they can be left in safely for up to 12 hours without leaking or risk, they can be worn at night, worn while swimming, worn before your period is due and some even worn during penetrative sex. Menstrual cups are also cheaper, more environmentally friendly and more body positive than tampons, as well as most brand offering money back guarantees if you do not like them, very few women send their menstrual cups back.

If you would prefer to stay with tampons then I would advise you use safer options such as organic tampons, sponge tampons or homemade tampons, this is because unlike commercial tampons these are all made from natural materials so less likely to cause the sort of vaginal splitting you see from commercial tampons also these materials are less absorbent so minimise risks, unlike commercial tampons these other tampon options do not contain unnecessary chemicals.

It this due to my lifestyle or am i getting sick??Anyone have any remedies??","Is it Migraine Headaches?
Signs to look for:
1. Low preasure front in your area. Is it about to rain or an overcast day?
2. Triggered by food allergies? Such as Cheese, food colouring, red wine, alcohol, Red wine vinegar, ginger chocolate., and many more can be added to this list. 
Also watch for the combination of 1 and 2 togather. As one trigger alone amy not be enough to cause a headach.
Also signs of a migrain headach: sensitivity to light and sound. Blurred vission. pain in one eye. headaches tend to be felt on one side of the head, but speaking from much experience pain can be felt in other areas as well. Nausuea and or vomiting. Can result in dry coughing (which is vomiting until you have nothing left in you but your body keeps vomiting anyway, painfull)

 Treatment : cartain Migraine medication prescribed by your doctor.  or ADVIL / ADVIL LIQUID / MIGRAINE ADVIL. 
Never take Tylenol for a Migrain head ache as Tylenol will cause 'rebound' headaches a day or two latter which can be just as bad or worse than the original head ache. Don't wait until the pain is too terrible before taking an ADVIL as delaying can result in vomiting and dry coughing which could have been otherwise avoided. Avoid your triggers especially if you have a headache in progress.

That's simply not true, and it's the reason why so many people aren't diagnosed until it's too late.

Do you exercise much, or has the weather changed lately? It could be a bit of prickly heat. I get it from time to time and your description sounds similar to what I experience. If it's prickly heat, in an adult it's usually nothing to worry about and will go away - though the thing that makes me doubt this diagnosis is that it doesn't bother you at all. Prickly heat is often quite irritating, but then, everyone's different.

I really think you need to see your doctor on this one, just to be safe. Not everything that hurts is dangerous - but not everything that's painless is harmless.",skin disease,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,any ideas as to what i have?,,,,,,Not applicable,,,

But now I am having a different pain than I ever have before its like a stomach ache and it lasts for hours with it I can heartburn and the usual bad bowel movements.

Could this be from the Dicetel, a new symptom of IBS or a underlying cause of Crohns or a ulcer?

Because these pains remind me of a flu but I have no other signs and its been going on for a while.","I'm not familiar with your medication, but I do know that they're starting to suggest that people with IBS be tested for Celiac Disease.

I'm 34, my oldest child is 15 months, and I'm suffering a bit with a flabby tummy after 2 kids in 3 years :)

I eat pretty healthily - when I tried to count calories, I'm not exceeding 1500 cals/day. I eat vegetables with meals, don't snack, do have a sweet tooth, but don't indulge it that often!

I am however 13 stone or so, and only 5'0. This puts me in the clinically obese category. 

I was born with club foot (both feet). Have had 8 operations on one ankle and 3 on the other. It's left me with chronic osteoarthritis in my ankles, which means walking etc etc very painful, and I'm on disability as a result. Swimming would be great, but with 2 kids and a husband who works odd shifts, it's not possible to get to a pool. 

A variation on Atkins' carb counting worked for a while - I lost about a stone, then the weight loss just stopped. Slimming World & Weightwatchers (despite sticking very carefully to them) didn't work at all. Any other ideas to help me lose weight?",I cant stand fools who don't read everything through and always discount medical reasons.  With your limitations I would suggest pilates which is a physically demanding set of exercises which will increase flexibility and was created to rehab dancers and perhaps a stationary bike.

49,222746,What happens after preeclamsia?,"When I was pregnant with my son (my first and only pregenancy) I was diagnosed with preeclampsia. Because of that my obstetrician induced labor two weeks before my due date and took the baby via a c-section as he was concerned that my blood pressure was going up despite my medication dosage being increased. After I had my son and went to visit my doctor for my 6 weeks check up, I was told that my blood pressure had returned to normal. However a few months ago (January/ Febuary) I had to go to the doctor, and during that time when a routine blood pressure check was done, the doctor found that my blood pressure was high. I was prescribed medication for a few days to settle it; the doctor thought the blood pressure could have risen because of lack f rest. However recently I have found that my heart at times gives this fluttering feeling and my pulse races at times. I'm going to have a medical check-up, but is this a sign that I'm hypertensive at just 26 years old?!","Wow, you kinda tucked two questions in there.  One at a time...

(1)  What happens after preeclamsia? 
A:  PREeclampsia is a set of three conditions:  hypertension, protein in the urine, and edema (swelling).  Eclampsia is what happens after preeclampsia, and that's a seizure.  Preeclampsia is VERY serious, the usual treatment is to end your pregnacy (usually but not always, with an induced delivery).  However, preeclampsia can happen up to (but not more than) six weeks following delivery.  What ever is going on with you is NOT preeclampsia.  

(2)  but is this a sign that I'm hypertensive at just 26 years old?! 
A:  Fluttering and racing pulses are not related to hypertension.  They may be serious, they may not.  The hypertension that you went through was most likely due to a shallow implantation of your fetus.  If the fetus doesn't implant deep enough into your uterus, then the arteries feeding the placenta cannot grow big enough, and your body compensates by increasing its blood pressure in an effor to nourish the child.  Preeclampsia is definately not a concern.  But that doesn't mean there can't be other things wrong too.",preeclampsia,25-34 years old,Female,,,,,,recently I have found that my heart at times gives this fluttering feeling and my pulse races at times.,my blood pressure was high / preeclampsia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,is this a sign that I'm hypertensive at just 26 years old?!,,,,,,Not applicable,,,

This poor litlle guy has had major trauma with being removed from his home and placement. The biggest concern we have is when he gets really mad he will throw his head against objects or the floor. One time he picked up a little childrens chair and threw it and screamed. I told him I would not listen to him do that and when he was done to please pick up the chair and put it back. I walked away and a couple of minutes later when he was quiet, I saw that he HAD in fact put the chair back and said sorry. I asked if he was feeling better, he said yes and we hugged it out and I told him that the behaviour is not aceptable and I don't want him to keep hurting himself. He has major speech and language delays. Any advice on how to help a child that hurts himself? We predict this scenerio when leaving a fun activity/place as well. Any coping techniques? Not hitting, please. Transition help?","Wow! This poor little guy has gone through a lot of changes! What a good person you are for doing your best to support him! Temper tantrums are caused by children who are not getting their needs met. If they are not throwing a tantrum because they are sick, hungry, or tired, they will throw a tantrum because it feels powerful, they get attention for it, they are testing limits, or they are simply feeling frustrated. I think youy son is just feeling pretty powerless right now.

Avoid punishing or threatening. When he throws a tantrum, do the unexpected. Either walk away or move him to a quiet place (his room, the couch) and say ï¿½When you are ready to calm down then you can come back.ï¿½ Say nothing more than that. This can be his place to vent. This is not a time out because you are not setting a time limit (you controlling him). He returns when he is ready to control himself. You may have to return him to the designated spot before he gets the message. I like how you asked him if he was feeling better. I think itï¿½s the perfect thing to say once he is calm.

Empathize with him when he has calmed down. ï¿½I can tell you were feeling very (mad, angry, upset, hurt, sad, frustrated). What can we do about that?ï¿½ or ï¿½I can tell you miss the other home you were staying at. It makes you feel sad that youï¿½re not there anymore.ï¿½ Do some problem solving and give him words to use. He will then learn to better express himself.

When he is hurting himself, express your feelings. ""I'm worried you might get hurt. It upsets me when you do that."" Give him something to take his anger out on. You could give him a special pillow or find one of those punching clowns (just a throught). It may help redirect his anger from himself to another object.

Help him to feel powerful by saying thing like ï¿½Look how fast you can run! You did that by yourself! You stacked every block! You used so many colors on you picture!ï¿½ These are intrinsic motivators rather than extrinsic rewards (""Good job,"" stickers, candy).These phrases are great ways to help your son feel powerful, gain confidence, and show attention in a positive way.",tantrums,,,,,,we hugged it out,we hugged it out,The biggest concern we have is when he gets really mad he will throw his head against objects or the floor.,tantrums,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Any advice on how to help a child that hurts himself?

he also needs professional help.  it sounds like he is already receiving this, but, if not, he needs to talk to a therapist, even if his problems are nutritional.  after four years, it has probably developed into a more serious problem, and simply feeding him fruit won't fix everything.  now, i'm not endorsing the use of drugs, especially in someone so young, but they may be helpful if other treatments, such as counseling, diet & exercise changes, and behavioral therapy don't seem to work.  has he been diagnosed by a professional, or do you just think that he has depression and anxiety? he may have a learning disability, OCD, and/or social development problems, as well as the depression/anxiety. before treatment begins, he needs a definite diagnosis.  also, if he was diagnosed years ago, his problems may have changed or he may have developed new issues (this is fairly common).  find a psychiatrist that he and his father feel comfortable with, and follow their suggestions.  talk with a nutritionist and the boy's doctor about his diet, maybe they could explain to him how important eating healthy is, and what will happen if he doesn't, then tell him (and you) how to change eating habits.  set a good example for him, and offer healthy snacks after school.  it sounds like he does have a psychological problem, as well as a nutritional one, and he needs treatment for both.  make sure the therapist (find one that specializes in children) knows of your concerns about his diet, this is important information, and may dictate the proper treatment.

I've noticed that my left shoulder in particular has been making popping sounds during the incline press in particular.  Am I doing something wrong?  Any specific stretches I can do?

Thanks :)","Most commonly what you are experiencing is some slight swelling in your biceps muscle, causing it slip over a spot in the upper arm bone (humerus). Couple things you can do to help. Make sure you are always stretching well before and after weights, ice and Advil for any pain, and make sure you are not overtraining or using incoreect mechanics. It probably won't go away, but if it gets any worse you may need to back off the harder shoulder work and use less weight.

Also a good tacket is if telling her all that stuff doesn't work, have her lay down on the couch close her eyes and have her a ""funeral"" (I know it sounds bad,but it really does help) she is not aloud to talk. But you all come up to her say everything you love. And talk about how the disorder killed her and how it has affected you. Tell her what ended up happening to all of you after she died.

He also needs a Frenulectomy (where they snip that little piece of skin tht connects your lower lip to your bottom gums) because his is too short & is what caused his gums to recede.  The total cost for both is around $970.  (I'm expecting the insurance to cover about 80% of that.) They say the graft site on the roof of your mouth feels like it might feel after getting burned from eating really hot pizza.  But since my son is only 8, we're going with the alloderm grafts instead, because it will be less invasive & less painful for him.   The peridontist said the whole thing should take about 1/2 hr to 45 minutes.  Supposedly the mouth heals very quickly, so I'm sure he'll be good to go by Monday.  We were told he will need to eat cold & soft foods for the next day or so & gradually return to a normal diet.    As far as what it will look like, I don't even think we'll ever see it unless we look for it, since it's the bottom 2 teeth, which are almost always hidden by his lip, anyway.

It's good your brother is getting the care he needs.  Cellulitis is infection and can become serious, if he has active infection right now he should NOT be in therapy, when the infection has cleared it would be ok to treat again.  The swelling and heaviness of the fluid pressing on nerves can be very painful.  Alot of us with the condition have chronic and debilitating pain.  Has he been evaluated for fibromyalgia?

Is there anything like natural capsules or pills I could take from a Natural Health Store to fight them QUICK from the inside?? Thanks!!","(Iam not associated with this site)
Based on a study conducted on the various types of oregano, it was determined that these herbs were able to kill bacteria due to the heavy content of phenolic substances found in their cellular structure. 

Oregano, by connecting the free radicals released from the cells within its contents, is very healthy and improves the body's cell protection system. 

Oregano prevents the formation of cancer and diabetes and regulates the level of cholesterol. This characteristic prevents tumors and slows ageing of cells. 

Natural protector: 

As we all know, many additives are used to protect food against spoiling. Although scientists believe these chemical additives have no adverse effects on humans when used properly in correct amounts, they still recommend using natural preservatives. This is where oregano comes in. It is even possible to say the miracle of oregano is that, as a natural food preserver, it eliminates the adverse effects and risks that chemical additives have. 

For Warts or Boils: Saturate affected area(s). Cover with a bandage. Repeat dressing until lesions are clear.

2,3128510,"does anyone know whats up with trans fats, how harmful they are to the body?","i was reading about it and i think its impt for ppl to know.  the US FDA, just passed a law requiering food companies to put the amount of trans fats on their products, but if the amount of trans fats are less than 1% it cualifies it to be posted as 0% trans fats.  why are Euro countries taking heavier actions against trans fat than the US (see how 3 out of 5 ppl are obese or on the verge of obesity)?","There is a great deal of scientific research on trans fats.  They are 'nasty' buggers!

Trans fats become incorporated into you cell membranes where they disrupt cell membrane function.  This can literally 'cause anything and everything' to go wrong with cell function.

Trans fats raise LDL cholesterol levels and lower HDL levels (the 'good cholesterol').

Cancer, heart disease, hypertension, brain/mood disorders, inflammation, etc. are related to trans fats.  No level of intake is 'safe', which is why the law allowing small amounts in foods to pass as 'no trans fats' is a 'bit of a problem'.

Best wishes and good luck.

Note: 'Thin' does not know what he is talking about.  First, trans fats are UNSATURATED fats (not saturated fat).  Second, if 'Moderation"" includes some intake/exposure to toxic substances, there can still be many, many, many nasty health problems which may seriously impair your ability to ""enjoy your life"".",trans fats,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,why are Euro countries taking heavier actions against trans fat than the US (see how 3 out of 5 ppl are obese or on the verge of obesity)?,,,,,,Not applicable,,,

4,1055071,A question for someone who is bipolar or close to someone who is bipolar....?,"My grandmother is bipolar.  She quit taking her meds 2 years ago, but seemed mostly ok until January when my grandfather died.  After his death, she completely freaked out and went manic, spent $50K on junk, and had visions.  We got her to take her medicine again, but as soon as she felt better she quit taking it.  Now she is acting nuts again, but instead of being happy and manic, she is extremely anxious.  She worries about completely irrational things, she says she doesn't have any money (she has a ton of money in the bank) and can't afford groceries, she thinks people are planning to rob her or attack her, etc....We got her to go to her psychiatrist, and he prescribed Zyprexa, Zanax (sp?), and Depakote, but they don't seem to be working.  She has been taking these medicines for a month now, and she hasn't had any improvement.  She absolutely refuseds therapy and hospital care.  What are your experiences with bipolar disorder, and what can I do for my grandmother?","I am also bipolar, and very knowledgeable about the illness.. The doctor always knows best but has no real chance of being in a position to help if he has to make guesses at her condition. 
I am thinking that perhaps her bipolar disorder may have morphed into a more serious combination of many different afflictions as a result of her age and the traumatic loss of her life partner..
Find a way to speak with her doctor or psychiatrist and explain the finer details of her actions.. she may not be honest with him because of the paranoia of how he might try to help.. might be schizophrenia, dementia, post traumatic stress disorder.. or even being bipolar with new tendencies (it gets much worse over time, especially when treatment is abandoned and she stops the meds) 
look into these possibilities. Doctors know best, always.. but they need your help to be effective, especially in your grandmothers case.. when she isn't being very cooperative and taking a much more proactive approach towards her own wellbeing. She needs her medicine.. and she needs your help to get this under control. It seems that she is in a bad spot with being so mixed up in all of the emotions of what is happening all around her. Powerlessness is a horrible thing.. it seems she desperatly needs a helping hand. 
Educate yourself to whatever the possibilities for her behavior might be in a clinical sense so you can be helpful to the doctors.

6,2842187,Question About Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.?,"I know that this is not a medical community but perhaps someone here will have information on this for me.  Opinions are also helpful.

10 years ago my b/f was in a car accident with 2 friends and he was the only survivor. Although he was not the driver in the accident he has suffered from PTSD and completely stopped driving. Since that time he has tried driving a few times but each time he tries he has so much stress that he vomits afterward (sorry for being gross) and does not look forward to trying again. 

Now he has just started an awesome job and is very excited.  We both agree that with the field he is working in it would be very good for him to be able to drive again. 

So last week he started his new job driving on his own, about 20 min. each way but is having a hard time - getting sick and stressed.

Its only been 8 days but I'm worried that this is hurting him more than helping him. Has anyone dealt with this? Do you think he might get better?  What should he do?","If you have not experienced PTSD, it's hard to explain the feeling.  If you know any older citizens who served in the Gulf War,  Vietnam War or even World War II, for instance, you can ask them about being ""shell shocked"", or PTSD.  For some people it never goes away.  I know from experience (an almost fatal auto accident that crippled me and took my professional life away at no fault of my own) that it's still there, under the surface, after 5 years.  However, I made myself get in the car and deal with it.  I think your b/f is on the right track and I'm impressed that he's willing to face his greatest fears.  You go ahead and encourage him every way you can and let him be a man and have a full life again without being co-dependent on anyone else.  He doesn't need to be an emotional cripple. What would he do if you weren't there to drive him??  He'll be proud of himself before long.  A pat on the back goes a long way.  So he might have stressful moment or two; he can learn to deal with it and get stronger and should continue to get professional help as long as he needs it.  He probably is feeling guilty as hell because he lived; not to mention every thing else involved.  Let him go...give him a nudge and hold him when he needs it.  Encourage him to help others with this problem.  Helping is great healing therapy for him and others.  He'll be living with this for a long time.

I had sex on the morning of the 6th. since then I have been feeling some pregnancy symptoms, which i guess could also be pms stuff too. but i have never had these kind of things happen to me in pms. Like breast tenderness and fullness, exhaustion in the afternoon, even if i haven't done much all day, mild headaches, and also some nausea but not to the point that I would have to go to the bathroom. 
So could I be pregnant or is it just pms?","If you have any of these pregnancy symptoms, and have missed your period be sure to take an at home pregnancy test, it is almost certain that you are pregnant!! 

A missed menstrual cycle can be a sign of pregnancy. It is usually the first indicator of pregnancy, although some women claim to know they are pregnant before they miss a period, since your period is not yet due, you should take the other points into consideration;

Tender swollen breasts are another early symptom. While tender breasts are a symptom of an impending menstrual cycle, swollen breasts are not. Sore and swollen breasts with a tingling sensation can be an early indicator of pregnancy;

Fatigue can be another indicator of pregnancy, especially if other symptoms are present. A nap a day can help a pregnant woman maintain normal daily activities.

It seems that you are experiencing most of these symptoms and only the missed period has not been experienced, simply because the date of your next period has not been reached.

Conclusively ( I am no Doctor) I would put some stakes on 'you are pregnant'(I am no gambler either.

I want to know exact reasons of recession - whther it is too much brushing, bruxism (clenching of teeth - nightguard needed and how to measure bruxism?), alchohal, plaque deposits or anything else? and if I reduce all risks how long will it take for tooth loss to happen? currently I have almsot 4-5 mm of recession on outer side of all teeth while no recession at all on inside of teeth except for lower front teeth (which are mis-aligned and thus gather more plaque).

I recommend, #1 see a dentist for a comprehensive exam and voice your concerns. #2 QUIT SMOKING (it increases your risk of periodontal disease). #3 Keep up with regual dental visits (often people with gum disease need to have cleanings and maintianance every 3-4 months). In most cases, someone as young as you are who practices good home care can reverse some of the loss or at least halt the disease in which case you could keep your teeth your entire life.

Paget's Disease is a rare form of breast cancer, occurring in only 1% of all cases. It can be associated with in situ carcinoma as well as invasive carcinoma.

Thanks a lot!","There is not a lot of info out there regarding what can happen after surgery.  You might search out a doctor who is comfortable talking about these issues.  Here is some info I found:

Anal sex shouldn't hurt. Having hemorrhoids can make anal sex painful. People who find anal sex painful often do not use enough water-based lube; others are not relaxed or aroused enough. Using lots of lube  which makes anal (and vaginal) sex more slippery and wet  can increase pleasure for both you and your partner. Relaxation will also minimize or prevent the possibility of tearing the thin lining of the rectum, and make insertion easier and more comfortable. Some people relax by taking a warm bath; others begin with a massage, starting with the butt and inner thighs, then gently playing in and around the anal sphincter with a finger. As the sensations become more comfortable and pleasurable, some people experiment by placing more fingers inside the anus. Others might progress to a small sex toy, or be ready to be penetrated by a larger toy, or even a penis. Communication with your partner about what feels good and how you want to be touched is essential for enjoyable anal play.

Although you can have anal sex when you have hemorrhoids, it's better to wait until they've healed. Friction and pressure from penetration can cause further irritation, discomfort, and pain. In addition, hemorrhoids that bleed may place you at increased risk for HIV infection, since the HIV virus can be transmitted more easily through an open ""cut"" or ""wound."" Whenever you have anal sex  if you have hemorrhoids or not  it's safer to use condoms and lube if you don't know your partner's HIV status.  http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/1925.html?CFID=277115&CFTOKEN=97076474
I am a woman who recently experienced my first hemorrhoids. They were painful, revolting and extremely embarrassing. Sitting in the stirrups while my doctor treated them was humiliating enough -- I couldn't bear to ask her this question: how long should I wait before I have anal sex? PAIN IN THE... 

Again with the ass and me calling doctors! The Hassle Free Clinic says you can proceed with anal sex ""when you feel comfortable,"" but use plenty of lube and take it slow. 

Some invasive surgery in the genital/anal area takes about six weeks to heal completely, but a hemorrhoidectomy, according to Heidi at Dr. Stubbs' office, may take only a week, depending on the severity of your condition and whether the procedure is done at a hospital or clinic. Looks like you'll be riding that red-eye flight again in no time.

They can help alot with different food plans to help you.

You're not used to eating and you have to start all over like a baby.  Start with a spoon of food, soft food, maybe oatmeal, every 2 hours, and slowly work up to a larger portion.  Eat just soft foods that are easy to digest.  Your electrolyte and hormones are probably way out of sync due to malnutrition so until you are able to eat better, you may have the mood swings and all.  You need to have potassium, maybe mash up or try to eat some bananas.  The bloating is because your body is storing gases and is not used to eating.  You just need to take it slow with small bites much like a baby when they are starting to eat solids.  Drink sips of water, don't try to swig down a glass.  Try an ounce or two with each spoonful of food.  Vary it, use fruit juices too instead of just water.

78,1966769,How much does diabetes impair your lifestyle?,"I'm not trying to offend anyone, but I was just wondering how different your life would be if you are diagnosed.

I'm sorry if this is 25 questions in one, but if you could answer this, it would help a lot.

Does the disease take over your life?
Can you still be active and athletic?
Can you still eat the occasional junkfood?
Does it screw up your sexual life and stuff?
Can you still have kids?
Do the symptoms of the disease go away after you are diagnosed? (ie. Will you still feel thirsty all of the time?)

Can someone tell me the lifestyle differences between Type 1 and Type 2?
I know that they are different, but is one easier to live with than the other?

Will you most likely die from the disease? What will your life expectancy be?

I just want some information on the disease, and I would appreciate it if someone could help me.","My life would be infinitely better if I had not been diagnosed with Type I diabetes at age five. More than anything, I try not to let it control my life or even think about it when I'm not preparing my insulin or testing my blood-sugar. I know I'll pay for that some day, but I would rather live a fuller life now.

I'm not really going mention Type IIs because I don't care; they screwed themselves and are not my problem. Their type is just a lifestyle disorder, not like with Type I, which is a genetic/auto-immune disorder.

Type I diabetics can be active, but we generally don't see the positive gains from such a lifestyle (weight loss, increased energy) than non-diabetics do. 

I eat junk food sometimes, but not high-sugar junk food. Mostly, I like sugar-free, low fat ice cream bars. Yum. Sugar-free pudding is awesome too.

For women, it doesn't serious effect their sexual functioning until pretty late in the game. The trouble is mainly finding a partner who can accept some of the limitations that diabetes places on them, like not wanting to risk a pregnancy. Personally, I would commit suicide before going through the hell of a diabetic pregnancy. I watched a friend's sister going through the worst sort of hell before dying at the end of her pregnancy. Not worth it!

For men, the sexual side effects can be devastating. At some point, they become completely unable to have or maintain an erection. It's much worse for diabetic men with Type II because they are also battling obesity and high blood pressure, much of the time at least.

As for kids, yes, diabetics can still have children; however, if the woman is the effected partner, then she would have to be willing to die or go through the rest of her life blind or with severely damaged kidneys. I'll reiterate: NOT WORTH IT.

Some of the symptoms go away with good control, including the thirst and excessive urination. Good control is almost impossible to maintain without surrendering your entire life to the disease.

Most likely, I will die in my early fifties from complications from the disease. If I had to guess which, I would say from cardio-vascular complications because heart ailments run in my family; I'm double-dipping, so to speak. Of course, I could be hit by a car tomorrow while having a blood-sugar level of 100, because really, no one knows. Each diabetic is different.

I read a research paper not long ago that said the following of diabetes: ""diabetes is one of the most psychologically and behaviorally demanding of chronic medical illnesses"".

90,3454475,What are the symptoms of anxiety depression?,"I've been having trouble with being able to handle things for the past couple years, and i'm wondering if there is really anything wrong with me. I'm having trouble concentrating on things, feel as though everything i have ever worked for and people i love are going to abandon me because i'm not good enough for them. There is a constant fear of them not liking me anymore. I've noticed that i feel alot more attatched to inanimate objects. I also have serious self-confidence issues. i don't know the situation i am in, and if desired i can tell more of how i am feeling.(i feel selfish saying that).if anyone is a phycologist, then i would appreciate your insight.","I'm not a psychologist, but I am a social worker. You do sound like you may have some depression and/or anxiety issues. The good thing is that you have already started the road to recovery by reaching out for help. Both depression and anxiety are very curable. I have had both of these, and counseling really helped me. 

Please know that when you are feeling like this is part of being down, and that things can get better. Your fears of not being good enough are very common to people who are depressed and people in general! I don't think there are many people who have not privately felt that they are not ""good enough"".  Self confidence can be learned. In the meantime, be gentle to yourself - you deserve it. 

You sound like you could benefit from going to counseling. There are many ways to do this. You can get a referral from a community information center or 211 if there is a 211 line in your area. If you do not have benefits at work, there are some non-profit agencies if money is an issue. Some faith communities have trained counselors as well.  If you have a good relationship with your family doctor, you could also talk to them about this and see if they have some referrals. I benefitted a lot from a book called Feeling Good by David Burns which should be in most major bookstores and libraries. Of course, there are many books that you might find helpful.

91,4124795,Doc upped my insulin intake to 80 units of Humulin every 24 hours. This makes my skin burn.

Just everything has to be very plain, no wheat, no sugar, basically no carbs, only veges and very lean protien. I had a gallbladder attack and they removed mine and I am only 27, after wards I did research and what I found out was very interesting, change your diet for a couple of weeks and see if that helps. I wish I would have known that, instead I had to lose a body part. I never had heartburn or issues before my attack, it just happened all of a sudden, but if you follow a low fat diet with no sugar you should be alot better in a couple of weeks.

Your stool is weird because your gallbladder is not releasing enough enzymes to break down the fat in your foods, so if you reduce or cut completely your fat intake your gallbladder will be able to catch up( I guess that is how you can word it).

Please try this before you have gallbladder surgery, I wsih that I would have known about this before I had mine out.

5,3320418,I have been living with insomnia for the past 20 years.?,"It is getting to the point now where I only get 3 to 4 hours sleep a night. I can not function right anymore, tired all the time. I have tried OTC sleepaids as well as prescription. Doctors also prescribed anti depressants to help me sleep, but all these medications do is make me dizzy, more tired and nauseous all day. I have tried valerian, hot milk, relaxing techniques and tapes, bla bla bla. Nothing works. At this point I am pretty much open to try anything no matter how crazy it sounds. lol (or not).","While I'm sure that JimmyR's links have this, I'll post it here:

I had a bad problem with insomnia for many years, and did some research on it.  Here are the things Iï¿½ve found that help the most.

1.  Don't take the sleeping pills.  Although they are not addictive in the way we tend to think (you won't jones for them if you miss taking them) they are addictive in the sense that once you have taken them for a while, you will have to take them to get to sleep, but they won't have the same effect they used too.   This is because you tend to not get the necessary REM sleep you need to be rested.  If you must take a sleeping pill, take it well before you go to sleep.  For instance, I prefer to take sleeping pills 2 hours before I go to sleep, so that the pill can get into my system and make me drowsy before I get into bed, then get out of my system (hopefully) early enough that I get some normal sleep.

2.  Try to go to bed at about the same time every night.  You have some wiggle room on this, but if you stay out on Saturday night till 3, it'll be harder to go to sleep at 10PM Sunday.

(Which somewhat contradicts:)

3.  If possible, don't go to bed if you're not sleepy.  Note  - one thing I have read and found to be true is that you have to be awake for 12 hours before you can go back to sleep.  So if you sleep till noon, again, you won't be sleepy at 10PM.  

4.  Don't spend more than 15-30 minutes trying to get to sleep.  If you notice that you've been in bed more than 15 minutes, get out of bed and do something for a while.  Make sure what you do isn't going to make you more hyper; e.g. no exercising or energetic music or writing posts to Great Debates (or reading GD for that matter ;) ). 

5.  When you go to bed, choose a chore or some other task that you do not want to do and tell yourself that if you are still awake in thirty minutes you will do that task.  Then, if you are still awake, get up and do your chosen task.  This is my favorite suggestion, as it has worked nearly every time I've used it. .

Those are the most useful suggestions I have.  Other things you can try:

Before you start getting ready for sleep, turn off high energy music and turn the lights down.  I love R&R music, but I went through a period where I had to turn the radio off every night about an hour before I went to bed, or I would be to wired to sleep. And our bodies react to reduced light by producing melatonin which puts us to sleep.  

Get plenty of exercise, but not right before bed.  (Unless you're weird like me - exercise right before bed just puts me to sleep)

Another suggestion that might work is to relax your body, consciously, one area at a time, starting from your feet. You think about the ball of your left foot and relax it, then the ball of your right foot, then the arch of your left foot, etc. You have to concentrate (pretty hard) on what you are doing.

Sex :D  by yourself or with an SO, it produces a nice soporific chemical, which does a nice job of putting you to sleep.",insomnia,,,,Nothing works.,insomnia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,At this point I am pretty much open to try anything no matter how crazy it sounds.,,,,,,Not applicable,,,
7,3652629,Lo-Ovral question for ginecologist...?,"I'm going to start using Lo-ovral.  My ginecologist is using the pills to change my period cicle (to have no period in my wedding day and honeymoon).  I'm getting married on Dec, and I'm a virgin so I'm paranoid because I don't want to get pregnant. 
I started using the pills on nov 6

I'm going to use this pattern:
First pack: start on nov 6- end on nov 21
Second pack: start on nov 26 -  en on dec 14
third pack: start on dec 21- end the package..and continue normal usage.  

What are the probabilities of getting pregnant... does this increase my chances of pregnancy??  Do my future husband have to use a condom for the first month??  Second opinion please.. Thanks in advance.","I know you asked for Gyno help, but not only is someone on here probably not a Gyno even if they say they are, but Gyno's can be really deceptive at times.

Let me warn you about a couple of things with the pill (and yes, I took lo-Ovral and have since researched the pill a lot).  The biggest thing of concern is that some birth control pills work in a way that could cause early abortion.  As a matter of fact, it is the low dose pills (which most of them are low dose now-a-days) that do cause the early abortion, because instead of preventing ovulation, they tend to stop implantation, so an already fertilized egg (your baby) can not come to you for the nourishment it needs and therefore dies.  Most Dr's don't inform you of this, I didn't know about it until recently (and I haven't been on BC in years) and had I known it I would have NEVER taken it as I am morally opposed to abortion in any form.  Lo-Ovral is a lower dose hormone, it may not work for you.  It didn't for me, I bled through constantly the entire time I was on it, it was horrible.  They upped me to a higher hormone, and it worked for a while, but then I went back to bleeding all the time.  In addition to this, I had the other typical side effects, like weight gain (oh that really sucks, esspecially if you are about to get married) loss of sex drive (you are going to do it for the first time and likely not even enjoy it like you should!) etc...

BC can actually permenantly destory your sex drive.  If I were you (or if I could go back in time and change what I did) DO NOT TAKE THE PILL.  Use a condom, the effectiveness is near the exact same but without all the nasty side effects and possible moral issues.  They have female condoms too.  And, if you are really scared, use spermicide and other things.  None of this in natural, the act of sex is the act of creating a child, so no matter what there is going to be a possibility of pregnancy.  One thing to look into in NATURAL FAMILY PLANNING and tracking your BBT and cervical mucous.  If you are in love with your hubby, I won't stress out too much, even if you did end up pregnant, children are absolute blessings and you will cherish that ""accident"" for the rest of your life.

Main point: Save your body now while you can, don't cause permanent damage to your sex drive and etc when you have other alternatives.  Trust someone who has been there.

Hope this helps and goodluck and hope you wedding goes well!",Lo-Ovral,,Female,,,,,,I'm paranoid because I don't want to get pregnant,pregnant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,What are the probabilities of getting pregnant,does this increase my chances of pregnancy??,,,,,"Yes: Let me warn you about a couple of things with the pill (and yes, I took lo-Ovral and have since researched the pill a lot).

4. No physical pain except...

I've also had bloodwork to see if I have malabsorption of certain nutrients, which could explain my difficulty in gaining weight and might indicate an intestinal or metabolic disorder. Those tests came back normal also.

I had a biopsy with removal of my breast lump at the age of 30 (I am 53 now).
Though I know that if I am diagnosed with Fibercystic Disease as was the case, new lumps can appear any time for the rest of our lives.
I had a girlfriend who had to have so many lump removals due to this disease that she eventually went ahead and had all of her breast tissue removed and replaced it with implants.(Her breasts had so many dimples due to the lump removals that the implants helped to smooth out her breast and took away future worry about more lumps,removal and the possibility of cancer.)
The older we get the more we really need to watch them as they can turn cancerous.
Avoiding cigarettes,caffine and chocolate is suppose to help lessen the possibility of having more problems with future lumps but I guess God has been on my side as I continue all 3 of them and have not had any problems(having gone thru menopause I suppose there is a possibility that I could start having problems,but so far so good.

5,2964508,"why is my 3.5 year old giving me so problems with eating lately, and why the sudden temper tantrums?","she has recently been giving me a really hard time when it comes to eating. normally, she eats A LOT! it used to blow me away at the amount of food she could consume in a day, now i'm lucky if i get 1 meal a day in her. i know kids will eat when they are hungry, but it seems that she just isn't hungry. this has been an issue for the last 2 weeks. also, she has NEVER thrown a tantrum, until last night. she threw such a fit, and got so upset, and screamed so much, that she made herself cough until she threw up...3 times! what's the deal here?","Wow. The first thing I would check is her interaction with people over the past couple weeks. Is she in Daycare? Does she have a play pal she's spending a lot of time with? Does she have a caregiver at home if you work outside the home?

Sometimes kids at that age have observed another person behaving in a particular way in order to obtain the desired result 
(ie. a tantrum that gets a child an ice cream or toy they want). She might be trying out this new negotiation technique.

Another thing about 3 1/2, they are learning a zillion new things each day and their little heads are full, full, full. Imagine if you worked in an office and you had 20 projects you needed to complete and your boss came in and dumped a huge stack of stuff in your inbox and said, "" I need this ASAP"". You might grumble after the boss leaves, but a three year old faced with a proportionally simliar moment will fling themselevs onto the floor and scream and cry until all the bad stuff goes away.

Try simplifying her schedule for a couple of days and try going on a food field trip to the grocery store. Take your time and show her all the pretty produce and things she might like and get a cheap little notebook to carry around to write down the list of all the things she likes. Then when you do your shopping, you can get a few things off her favorite list each time so she has some say in what goes into her tummy. You could go through magazines and cut out pictures of food or use the google image option and make her a ""Menu"" like she's got her own restaurant. You can split it up in pages of breakfast, lunch and dinner and special snacks. She can go through the picture book and select what she will eat and then you can show her how to spell that word and maybe how to make the food item (like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich)

Both of my kids went through the ridiculously picky eater stage about that age. They will survive! My son is 6'2"" and a college rower and my daughter is 5'10"" and a volleyball player and coach.  The month my son would only eat cubes of baked potatoes, Stouffer's spinach souffle, pizza, Cheerios, PBJ's and hot dogs I thought I was gonna lose it! She will move through it.

Temper tantrum solution: This is weird but IT WORKS. When kids are out of control, it scares them as much as it scares you.
Get an ice cold cup of water and very calmly tell her to take a sip and calm down. If she won;t, tell her she can drink it or wear it. If she continues to flail and scream ( and I know this sounds bizzare) toss the water right in her face. She will come to a complete stop and you will have her full attention.

Go and get another cup of ice cold water and ask her if she is now ready to have a sip of water. She will drink it- trust me. And the cold and sipping motion will calm her down enough to regain control of her self.

I only had to do this ONE TIME with my kids. Any time I saw a tantrum coming from then on, I would ask them if they needed a glass of water and they would calm down and even go get themselves a cup. 

It's a Horse Whisperer moment but I swear this works every time.",problems with eating,,,,,,,,,,,,"she has recently been giving me a really hard time when it comes to eating. normally, she eats A LOT!",problems with eating,,,,,,,,,,,,,"why is my 3.5 year old giving me so problems with eating lately, and why the sudden temper tantrums?",what's the deal here?,,,,,Yes: Both of my kids went through the ridiculously picky eater stage about that age.

9,3464579,My partner with Clamydia?,"2 years ago, my partner who is from another country I might add, went to her country at that time. She tells me via email the doctors told her she has Clamydia, I was shocked by this information. She told me to get tested, I didn't because of my anger, and I knew I had to symptoms what so ever. Then she tells me she is getting treated for it over there, her country. She comes back no problems. Fast forward to now, she again visits her country and bang again, they tell her again she has Clamydia. So this time I get tested, and I already knew the results, I have nothing! Are the Doctors in that country for real, or is there something going on. My question is if you have Clamydia and get treated for it, does that totally remove the Clamydia from your system, or does it somehow stay in your system like herpes or something. Or until you have sex with another infected person do you get it again after treatment a few years ago???","First of all, with this ""ping pong volley"" of chlamydia infection going on, you should know that there is strong probability of reinfection of this STD. For the infected person(s), there is a waiting time of at least a few weeks ,to a couple of months before they should engage in sex again, during treatment. A woman not treated could face possible infertility. STD's have no nationality or borders. Regardless of where she lives, one or both of you is not practicing safe sex! When sex is confined to marriage of two people faithful to each other, these type of problems can be avoided!

Is this a your primary care doctor or a psychiatrist? Your primary care doc may not have the best information, but if it's your psychiatrist, geez... 

Go back and get more specific. Ask for options or reading material. Do a Web search (www.webmd.com is a good place to start), and get your own information. Sometimes you have to take charge of your own care. 

You also should ask the school about adaptive teaching for you. This is a disability and they can make accommodations. My son has ADHD and needs extra time to complete papers becuase he has trouble focusing. He also takes his exams with a headphone playing classical music. It helps keep him from getting distracted by other things in the classroom. 

Good luck, and I wish I could offer more insight. I know there are medications for this, but you already may be taking them. One key is to take them all the time.

First check and see if the white stuff on your tongue can easily be scraped off.  If it can, then it is most likely a candida (yeast) infection.  Any condition in which your immune system drops (such as prolonged used of antibiotics, corticosteriods, or immunocompromising diseases like AIDS, chemotherapy, etc.) can predispose you to this infection. This infection can also cause redness of the tongue without the white coat.  If it is oral candidiasis, also called oral thrush, then antifungal treatment can be prescribed to you by a doctor. Now if the white stuff can not be easily scraped off, then the diagnosis is most likely something called leukoplakia that could be precancerous.  Either way, see a doctor.

Instead even though your baby is crying, keep her on your breast so that she can keep stimulating your breast and that will tell your body that it needs to make more milk.  Change her from breast to breast if you have to and eventually within a couple days you will produce more milk.  Also drinking lots and lots of water is very important.  You need lots of it to produce milk.  Eating Quacker Oatmeal atleast twice a day also helps.  There are also some teas(Mothers Milk tea, feenugreek and reglan are some) that you can buy at a health store that you can drink too, to increase your supply.  I was doing the same thing with my daughter when she was born.  She kept crying too so I started supplementing because I also thought I wasn't making enough milk for her.  But like the above people have mentioned, your milk is still coming in and all that so don't panic.  I contacted La Leche League and they helped.  Plus being in a forum for MOms on the internet helped me out a lot too because there are lots of moms that breastfeed there that had already been through this.  If not for them I would have stopped a long time ago.   I don't know if I can post there website or not, but the group is in www.forevermamas.com.

Shortness of breath and chest pain are typical symptoms of both.  Is it pneumonia??  Only a chest x-ray can diagnose that.  Patients with pneumonia and bronchitis complain of both of those symptoms so you need to see a doctor for a definative diagnosis and effective antibiotic treatment.  I know it's hard, but try to cut back on the smoking even if you are only smoking 8 a day.  Emphysema is characterized by shortness of breath all the time, not necessarily yellow sputum, but like the other person answering said, anyone can get it, even by 2nd hand smoke.  It is also characterized by a ""barrel"" shaped chest.  Use a cool mist humidifier in your room to ease breathing and it will help loosen the congestion so you can cough it up easier.  Use an expectorant cough syrup to also loosen congestion.  Drink plenty of fluids to thin the secretions and ease getting it up.

1,4007367,Doctors &/or surgeons please?,"I had a hysterectomy back in July and I know there is still healing going on. I am a surgical asst. so I understand the anatomy and procedure and limitations, but I still have a question. I'm 34, in good health, reason for surgery was uncontrollable bleeding and endometriosis, and pelvic pain. My husband has a large penis and I continue to have painful intercourse. Is it possible that the cervical cuff can not accomidate his size, or is it just part of the healing process?","Although I concur with my colleague, Doc8, that it is entirely possible for you to have remaining endometrial implants, I would disagree that your complaint pattern is suggestive of endometriosis pain.

In a hysterectomy, the uterus, including the cervix, is removed.  The upper edge of the vaginal cuff which remains is sewn shut in a ""purse-string"" fashion.  There is necessarily some loss of length within the canal because of tissue removal and the suture line involving even more tissue.  

The vagina is normally a highly compliant organ, which can stretch by length or diameter without much resistance.  However, after a hysterectomy, the former location of the uterus above the vaginal pouch is occupied by a raw space which fills with fibrous scar.  Scar tissue has a series of phases it goes through and for many many months, it is NOT compliant.  During the maturation phase of this scar tissue, I could easily envision that the normal compliance of your vagina has changed.  Now, there is significant resistance to stretch.

This is, of course, a guess.  However, the time period over which scar tissue matures and softens is well in excess of a year.  If my guess is wrong, then you'll know in about 6 to 12 more months when the problem still hasn't gone away.  

In the mean time, I would humbly suggest that you appeal to the basic principle of country doctoring:  If it hurts, DON'T DO IT! :)

This has really gotten me worried since it has been 1 full day and I'm still suffering from it. Do you think I have a stomach virus or something?","Farmer Girls answer is simplistic and incorrect.  Eating pizza will not give you shivers, dizziness or loss of appetite.  Did you eat the pizza while it was hot?  If not, did you warm it up prior to eating it?
Bacteria grow on pizza as soon as it starts to cool down, generally you've got about 2-3 hours after delivery to enjoy your pizza before you have to nuke it or put in a toaster oven.
This bacteria can cause you to have the symptoms you describe above..they are very similar to the flu.
GI (gastrointestinal upset) occurs when bacteria enter the digestive tract and your body can't handle the toxin.  Your body fights back by trying to expell the bad stuff any way it can.  That's when you see the vomiting and diarrhea.  Your body is ridding itself of the toxin, so it's really a bad idea to take drugs like Immodium.
What you ABSOLUTELY have to do is to keep fluids down.  Drink water primarily, or go to the store and buy some Pedialyte (in the baby aisle)...they are the best things for you if  you are throwing up.
If your vomiting / diarrhea persists or you get dizzy, see your doctor pronto.  Make sure to have someone else drive you if possible.

5,1189269,Why so much fat empathy?,"A few days back I posted a question about the difference between coughing at a smoker, and gagging at an obese person. Yes both are impolite, people have feelings, blah, blah, blah.

My question was more of a comment on political correctness. Both are rude, and we live in a country were you can say and do whatever you want, as long as it doesn't impede on the rights of others. If you want to smoke, you should be able to smoke, if you want to eat yourself to death, you have that right too. But lets not pretend that one is better then the other. Really, do you think that the number of people who suffer from these ""conditions"" that cause obesety is all that significant? Instead of making excuses, more people should own up to there faults.

I think is an allergy and try to reach her pediatrician but is gone since the morning and havenï¿½t answer me.","Well, u said the mucus is clear, which is a good sign. If it were green she might have an upper respiratory infection. I think she just has a little cold. Just have her sleep on her side, drink plenty of fluids, like Pedialyte, give her infants cold medicine. Just keep checking her temp. If she does get a temp, try a lukewarm bath and a cool rag on the back of the neck and groin area. If she gets a temp 200 or more, u will need to take her to a doctor. If you think it is an allergy, have u fed her any different food or drink that she has never had before? If not, it might just be dust and dander. Get an Oreck air purifier. They work wonders for the home. My son has terrible allergies and they have hardly acted up since I got my Oreck. If these symptoms continue in the next couple days I would suggest a quick check up with the doctor.",Stuffy nose,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,does anybody have any idea what this is and how can I treat it??,,,,,,Not applicable,,,

During this time I met quite a few patients with prostate cancer, some of them had been patients for years. The hospital where I worked had a research department and many Prostate patienets were recruited onto clinical trials, although there is usually an age restriction as they will not recruit patients if they are less than five years away from the average life expectancy (I think the cut off is somewhere between 75 and 80 I can't remember exactly. Some of the patients also had bone scans which showed secondary involvement. The treatments used ranged from radical prostatectomy to hormone treatment (this was used on research patients) and in most instances these treatments worked pretty well. However, I would hate to give you false hope, 374 is pretty high and the swollen lymph glands mean that there is a probability that the cancer has spread.

We had an Emergency room scare last weekend, where she complained of chest pains and difficulty breathing, The  hospital emergency room doctor gave her a breathing treatment, and said all looks fine, But today she is in the emergency room once again, and her sodium level is low, I have been told this is not good, this can cause alot of problems, she is also diabetic. Can anyone relate?","A tough question to answer because there is not enough info.  You stated your Grandmother has an enlarged heart and diabetes.  Does she have problems with CHF (Congestive heart failure)?  Is she using diuretics to get rid of fluid?  The use of diuretics can make the body dump sodium.  Also, normal kidneys can usually regulate sodium to keep a normal balance.  Diabetes long term is often the underlying cause of renal failure...so perhaps this is why the Doctors are concerned with her low sodium levels.  There are so many ""What & Why"" possibilities that her physician is really the only one with the answers. If the problem is caused by medications/treatment etc., adjustments can be made.  If the kidneys are not working adequately, then the problem is more complicated and it is possible that dialysis will be needed if your Grandmother decides to make that choice.  I am sorry that I cannot give you a definative answer, but please have someone in the family ask her physician the hard questions so the answers are known by all whether the news is good or bad.

18,4148753,Could I have ruptured my eardrum?,"Recently I've had nausea, headache, a cold, and maybe a little bit of tonsilitis for three or four days.  During that time, my ears twinged a bit, but didn't really hurt until last night.  I was relaxing, working on a nice Sudoku puzzle when I tilted my head.  I felt and heard fluid moving somewhere inside my inner ear.  I tilted it at a sharper angle, and it hurt.  That triggered throbbing, aching pain that I couldn't ignore.  Ibuprofen did nothing for it.  It lasted for about two hours, and during that time I paced, watched Law & Order, and tried to sleep, but it just wouldn't go away.  Finally, when my sleeping pills kicked in, I yawned, and something happened.  It popped a little bit, and the fluid moved.  The pain went away.  I moved my head around and it throbbed just a bit, but it was basically gone.  I don't know if any discharge came out because I was under the influence of sleeping pills and went to sleep very shortly afterward.  Could my eardrum have ruptured?","You could have a perforation (a small, tiny hole) in your eardrum which results from pressure withing the middle ear and it is usually called Otitus Media.  If your eardrum burst you would have blood trickling out of your ear as well.  I have had this happen and the pain got so intense, even sleeping pills and/or painkillers didn't help. Up to the point of it bursting, it was incredibly painful.  As soon as it did burst, all the pain went away but there was blood coming out of my ear.  It was actually a relief to me because it was intensely painful and as soon as it burst, I had no earache anymore.  Burst tympanic membranes will heal and you should get some antibiotics to clear up the infection in your middle ear so it doesn't keep happening.  Scar tissue will affect your hearing if it happens too many times.  Hope this helps.

This can cause a greenish yellow discharge Which  is infection Around the area will be reddish and sore looking. It will be most painfull when urinating.

Whatever it is, it sounds as if it has been affecting the  wee lassie for a time and some. Basically it would have an adult in tears and tantrums.

It could be a reaction to a bubble bath or soap used.
It could be a food allergy she has.
It could even be lack of cleanliness with the adult(s) that take care of her.

Are the odds against me?,"First off my husband had a vasectamy for his ex wife but then they divorced and he and I married and we want to try for a child of our own.  He had the surgery a little under 7 years ago, and in another post I saw that a man's body can develope antibodies against his own sperm after years of disconnection.    Is this true and how many years does it take?  Also he had rhumatic fever when he was a child which he says can render one sterile.  He has 2 children, but there's a very high chance that they are not biologically his anyway so that doesn't tell us anything.  So we have that goig agaist us, plus there's my situation.  When my mother had cancer I was her primay care giver.  One of her treatments was a high dosage of radioactive iodine and she was to be quarentined for many weeks.  As the weeks went on people could be with her more and more.  However since I was her primary care giver there's a chance I was exposed too much.  Can this cause fertility problems?","First off...my husband had a vasectomy reversal under similar circumstances.  Six weeks after he had the surgery, I was pregnant with our first daughter.  Our odds were only 5% that we'd get pregnant...that was two kids ago.  So ignore that anti-body bologna.

Secondly, radio-active medication would depend on exposure.  Keep in mind that your mom's situation is a WAS, not CURRENT.  

If I were you, I would go for a free consultation at your local fertility clinic.  The standard IVF procedure can run up towards 20K...so the clinic will be responsive to a free consult, but also realistic with your chances.

When it's all said and done, if your husband had two children with his first wife (let's just assume that at least one of them actual was HIS) you probably will have success with a reversal and resulting pregnancy.

In fact it is more the rule than the exception that this is misdiagnosed.My mother came down with it after the flu shots were started. Has your father had the 
flu shot ? The drug companies now have insurance to cover this eventuality. Contact the drug company that made the shot. Maybe they will give you some help with the medical bills. My mother had that over twenty years ago and I didn't know she had had the oral vaccine when it first came out. If I had that knowledge I would have advised her to contact the manufacturer.  As it was my parents did not have Medical insurance. And they used up their life savings paying the hospital bill.  She was hospitalized for a month but that was over 20 yrs. ago when there was no treatment for this disease.  The prognosis is as weird as the disease. It is the only neurology disease that you can fully recover from.  However some people are left with permanent effects that range from a mild limp to paraplegia.That was at the time of the unknown treatment.  My mother was left with a dropped left foot.

30,534237,Endometriosis and hysterectomy???,"I had severe endometriosis for years and got a hysterectomy (they took everything) when I was 25 (ten years ago).  However, for the past few years I have been having moderate to severe cramps, getting worse all the time.  I even told my friend I felt like I was going to start my period.  I just read that hysterectomies don't necessarily cure endometriosis, especially if your doc leaves some in you when you have your hysterectomy, which mine did.  It makes sense to me that it would take this long for my cramps to become severe again, as the disease would need time to grow.  Has anyone had this same experience, or similar?  I am really stressed about it.  Especially since I heard that it is not only possible but common.  My hysterectomy was totally worth it to me because my pain and hormone imbalance was so severe.  But now that I am in pain again, I just don't know.  I am a little scared because I don't want to go through this again.  Even though I already have been for a few years.  Wow, does this even make sense???","Now for a sensible answer that doesn't contain erroneous information recommending futile treatments or try to sell you supplements:

There is no definitive cure for Endometriosis, hysterectomy included.  Because Endo makes its own estrogen synthesizing enzyme, called aromatase, it is able to sustain its own life cycle even after hysterectomy.  If there is any disease left behind, it will continue to cause symptoms, period.  You need to have it removed via excision by an expert, such as Dr. David Redwine at www.endometriosistreatment.org or Dr. Albee at the Center for Endo Care in Atlanta at www.centerforendo.com.  Those specialists use excision - not ablation, vaporization or other superficial removal - and routinely excise all disease from all locations, including bowels, bladder, ureterus and other advanced areas.  Hang in there and don't mess around with local docs who say that it ""couldn't be removed"" - what they mean is, THEY couldn't remove it.

35,892315,Gimpy ankles tendons in the morning?,"Hello all,

Just a question. I am a 27-year-old woman and I am wondering if this is normal. Whenever I go to bed or say I am napping whether its a 1 hour nap or I am getting up from a nights sleep I have to hobble out of bed until I get moving more--this has been going on for the last couple of months it almost feels kind of like tendonitis in the ankles, however my calves are so tight when I first get up that they hurt to move as well...I mean I am not 18 but I am not old either is this normal you think or is it just from being stiff from sleeping through the night? cause once i get moving around I can walk just fine and stuff. 

just curious--thanks--Jammiegirl","It's true as you get older things start to break down and not work so well.  Weird, sporadic problems- they are so annoying.

But this case is troublesome.  If they are tight and painful, it may be like the other person said here - achilles tendonitis.  You could have injured it or overworked continuously and unknowingly it into a chronic condition.  Of course, day to day activities, normal activities are going to aggravate it.

You may want to try to supplement with a few things.  Firstly, you need something anti-inflammatory that works.  The only anti-inflammatories on the market that I give credence to are plain 'ole aspirin and New Chapter 'Zyflamend' and 'Mycomend'.  Zyflamend is an incredibly strong and advanced herbal formulation that is winning folks over by it's scientifically proven efficacy.  I'd start with low-dose aspirin, use it 3 days on, 3 off. 

Mycomend takes more the Eastern medicine angle with 'time-honored' Chinese medicine and the use of specific mushrooms like reishi and maitake to reduce inflammation.  That's more of a *suggestion* than a recommendation like the aformentioned zyflamend.  

You may also want to supplement with those other joint-supplements like MSM, glucosamine and chondroitin.  I can't speak from experience about those, but people seem to talk a lot about them.

Personally, I would just take additional calcium/mag/zinc and C so your tendons can repair themselves and get lots of sleep and plenty of water.  Also, it helps to believe that these things you are doing are helping you.  Because if you do, they will!

37,1573821,Can a stroke affect only one personality in someone with multiple personalities?,"This is strictly conjecture on my part. My recently deceased mother had a serious stroke.

What may have happened with your mother is that she attempted to speak and get your attention, but it came out differently then her own voice because of the stroke.

I know from experience that as long as I get time to myself and can be myself then I have no trouble with any one personality ""taking over"".

My question is, what is the basic principal of eating as a diabetic?  Is there an amount of protein/carbs/fat that one should eat to maintain a constant glucose level in the blood?  Or a specific timing?  

Thank you so much for your help.","Limit your carb intake. The body turns all carbs into sugar. With simple carbs; sugar, honey, syrup, etc. the body converts these quickly causing your blood sugar to spike so avoid these. Complex carbs like rice, oatmeal, beans, etc. take longer to convert so your blood sugar doesn't spike, but it will still go up. You also have to be careful not to eat too much protein. Protein won't effect your blood sugar, but will effect your kidneys which are already working overtime trying to get rid of the excess sugar. Make an appointment and talk with a dietitian. In the meantime practice portion control. That's where most of us get in trouble. 1/2 Cup is a serving of starch like corn, beans, pasta, potatoes. 1 Cup is a serving of raw veggies and 1/2 Cup cooked veggies = a serving. 1 oz. of meat = 1 serving of meat. Watch your diet and talk with a dietitian and you should be able to control your diabetes without having to go on meds.

1,2500038,What causes a headache in the same spot above an eye?,What could possibly cause this kind of a headache...It's usually in one spot above the right eye. This has been going on for about 9 months now and the headaches come randomly about 3-4 times a week (doesn't seem to be caused because of change in weather). The pain is usually sharp just in that area. Could this be serious or is it just a normal thing to deal with? What can cause this and what can be done to prevent it other then to drink pills?,"Most headaches around the eyes are one of two types - either migraine, or sinus headache; you may be able to determine which one it is likely to be by the following:  

A migraine headache is virtually entirely on one side of the head; it is often accompanied by nausea, and sensitivity to light and/or sound.  Some people experience an ""aura"" shortly before the migraine begins; it can be visual, auditory, or even olfactory (sense of smell).  A migraine is often helped by being in a cool, dark room, and often disappears after a period of sleep.  The causes of migraines are not fully understood, but there are prescription medications that can help; ibuprofen helps some people, but usually it doesn't do much.  Some people also respond to medications or liquids containing caffeine.

Sinus headaches behave differently. Generally, the pain is on both sides of the face, and often worst near the cheekbones or around the eyes.  Light or sound generally have little if any effect on the headache.  Cool surroundings often make the sufferer feel worse; warm compresses or a heating pad often help.  Sinus headaches generally respond well to ibuprofen or Tylenol, particularly if combined with sudafed/pseudoephedrine (like Tylenol Sinus formula or a similar medication). 

If either one of these sounds familiar, then check with your doctor - particularly if it is a migraine, as the only really effective migraine medications are prescription-only preparations.  Even if none of the above sounds familiar, it sounds to me like it's time to see your doctor.

Anyone who has this disorder knows they have trouble communicating in their everyday life. I started to notice I cant yell, my voice sounds good one day then another day it sounds horrible.  People tell me it sounds whispery.  It cracks a lot. They say I mumble alot.  I guess you can say Iv'e adapted but theres so many things I cant do because of this disorder.  I was in the military and I struggled so much because theres a lot of yelling here.  Iv'e even thought of getting a microphone to do things that require communication.  I would appreciate some feedback.","There is no cure yet...depending on your type of SD, botox injections might help. It also sounds like you have a history of vocal abuse. You should see an ENT to make sure there isn't anything organically wrong. A speech-language pathologist can then help you with possible voice treatment.

This should have been done initially if you suspected an STD which it does sound like. 
Many doctors in this day and age are beginning to decrease the amount of STD tests done, stupid it know, as they believe the STD epidemic is declining as people become more familiar with safe sex.

Back to your question, has this always happend when you have had sex? No? Then something has obviously developed. Either demand further testing from your doctor or give him/her a sample on the spot. Yes I mean go out and obtain a sample of the gunk on a swab. If you tell the doctor before hand they should be able to give you a pathology swab with a special tube to keep it in. 

Another variation on your symptoms is a blockage of the ducts out of the scrotum, this would cause a blockage and swelling of the vessels giving the illusion your right ball is swallon. Once the body acts to right this wrong the semen would ooze out as it is the only place it can go.

Either way you need to see a specialist if your doctor is being complacent about the issue!

25,225993,Link between immunity and moles/freckles?,"Ever since I've had a weak immune system (started off with glandular fever 5 yrs ago, then problems with chronic fatigue/post viral syndrome since, plus I have Candidiasis - all of which Im trying to treat) my skin has been prone to freckles and moles. I don't go out in the sun often (and I usually wear sunscreen) but Ive developed heaps of moles over the last 5 years. Before I had health problems I never had any moles, and spent more time in the sun than I do now.

A few people have told me I get them so easily due to having a weakened immune system. Can anyone confirm/give any further information about this suggestion?","It could theoretically be that your weakened immune system is not able to control cancerous growths like it used to.  Under normal circumstances, the immune system patrols the body, looking for cells that are growing out of control, and keeping them in check (usually by killing them completely but sometimes just by controling their growth).  If you are immunosupressed, your immune system can't patrol for these uncontrolled growths as well as it used to.  Moles are a type of uncontrolled cell growth that is usually kept in check by the immune system.  It could be that your immune system is no longer able to stop the growth of these moles and that is why they are suddenly growing.  The best thing you could do is talk to your doctor about them and, even more importantly, keep an eye on them.  Note their number, size, shape, and color, and if anything changes, definitely contact a doctor.  Your immune system plays a very important role in keeping cancer in check, so it's best to keep an eye on it yourself if your immune system can't.

26,289738,Does my child have insomnia?,I have a 3yr old daughter that lately will not fall asleep untill 4am.  When she does fall asleep its only for 3 to 4 hrs.  Its like she thinks she is taking a nap or something.  I recently quite my job and I have been staying up later at night.  I am wandering if this is a new faze or is it cause were not on a schedule anymore.  I am so exosted and don't know what to do.  I didn't even go to sleep last night cause she went to bed at 5am and then got up at 8am.  What is going on?  It's not like I am letting her stay up!  I try and try to get her to go to sleep!  HELP,"I am sorry for what is it happening, my daughter had that problem too until my mother gave me this checklist (very complete I may say) of things I should get rid off and things that I should do.
The checklist was not as nice as I will edit it for you, maybe it helps, good luck, honey!

THINGS TO CONTROL OR TAKE AWAY:

A. Sorroundings:

1. Strong lights at night.
2. Too much noise at night
3. TVs turned out late. The blinking lights keeps some children awake.

B. Diet
1. Anything in your daughter s diet that conteins caffeine or other stimulants, for ex. coffee, chocolate, tea, cinammon rollers (anything containing cinammon), give her milk sweetened with natural honey instead.

2. Too much solid food late at night. Keep the solid foods for before 4PM up until 6 PM max.

3. Too much sugar or sweetener in her food. You see, in toddlers sugar is a real booster, it is like jet gasoline in a car, be careful with it. Take away the soft drinks if you give her and substitute it with fruit juices (natural, please!).

4. A lack of salty foods. An desequilibrium of potassium make take away sleep (this is not my mother-s but my doctor-s advice). Give her a lot of vegetables. Tomato is a good one, carrot is another good one.

C.Activities

1. Children have at least 5 times the energy we adults have. It is amazing. She should do a lot of exercise during the day, that means that she is NOT in the age for a lot of mental activity, like watching TV, videos or that kind of stuff but dire hard physical one, she will endure it because THAT is the nature of toddlers. Get her a tricycle, she can wander around the house (you will be scared to know that she will actually do it ALL DAY.

2. She should not sleep at all during the day. Keep her excited.

3. If she has construction type toys, take them away for a while, for ex. building blocks or lego. That needs a lot of concentration that is probably building up stress in her. In other words, she keeps building those blocks during the night. That keeps her awake.

D. Relationships

1. I hope this is not the case, but fights or rows with your husband or partner builds a lot of stress in children. 
If this is the case, then you will have TO STOP it at Once, you are hurting your child. If this is not possible, keep the voices low or do not do it in front of her.

2. I hope this is also NOT the case, but do not be too strict with her, do not beat her, do not harass her, do not be too angry with her. If you live in confining spaces chances are that as a toddler she touches everything, exasperating you. Have patience. Better take her out for a walk to the nearest park. Do not be super protective. Sometimes children have to hurt themselves a little by themselves in order to learn.

3. Any brothers or sisters, or someone else in the family is making her life miserable? Watch out, please!

THINGS TO DO THAT CAN HELP A LOT!

A. Music:

1. Get some REAL relaxing soothing music, New Age will be good, but the ambient kind, for example, David Arkenstone. The music of Native American Indians (with all their pow wows dancing proved to  be Super super effective in making my child to go to sleep, I suppose it was because it resembles the rain somehow, you can get the CDs at 5US$ at amazon. But the best is Classic music, like for ex. Mozart, I can send you some tracks by email if you like. And do not put it loud, for heaven s sake! A low volume works.

B. Stories

Now, be a good mother and read her a story when you send her to bed. She will be bored to hell soon and fast asleep after that. But the thing is, toddlers just love it!

Print out this list and make a mark over the ones you have managed to accomplish. It should work, but if it doesn t, then you need to get her some sedative, like tylenol or nyquil for children and give her a teaspoon before sending her to bed.

There is no distinction between the lymphatic system and immunological system.  In other words, there is no immunological system.  Various kinds of white blood cells are responsible for fighting infection.  During an infection, the white blood cells often work in the lymph nodes, which is why they sometimes become swollen during an infection.  

Sinusitis is usually a bacterial or viral infection that has nothing to do with genetics, so it can not be passed on to a child.  Cystic hygroma is a birth defect caused by chromosomal abnormalities.  This is a rare condition.  You might want to research Monosomy X, Trisomy 21 and Noonan's Syndrome if you are looking for more information on cystic hygroma, as these are often the cause of the defect.  Allergies and bronchial asthma can run in families, but do not cause birth defects.

To feel completely separated from your sense of Self and your body goes hand-in-hand with eating disorders. Do you self-injure, too?

An eating disorder is actually a means of someone asserting control over their life when they feel they have very little. It is rarely a symptom of someone who wants to be thin, though it's very common that someone w/an eating disorder hates themself and wants to do themself harm.

Bulimia is a very common disease with successful, charismatic women who endure a lot of stress at work or in life in general.

I had to come at my bulimia and self-harm from a few different angles. Firstly, I got myself a good book -- The Secret Language of Eating Disorders by Peggy Claude-Pierre. I read it and took note of the things she said that resonated with me most.

I saw a therapist once a week for two years. It was pricey but completely necessary. It helped more than I can describe. Just telling someone about how awful you feel and how alienated you think you are, and having them console you and validate your feelings, is powerfully healing.

Start to write down things you like about yourself. Keep track of details  during the day that make you feel connected to yourself. Treat yourself to things throughout the day -- a positive thought, an inside joke with yourself, a cup of tea, anything.

I can relate to wanted to go back to your eating disorder. It feels safe and consistent and when you look at yourself and see your body as the result of your own control, well, it feels great. A therapist will help you with this. find a support group and meet with the people there.

I get slight stomach aches and headaches. My heart is beating so fast most of the time. Are there posibilities that i can be pregnant?","If you are having hetero sex there is ALWAYS the possibility of pregnancy.  

Take a deep breath and calm down.  You are still not late. A woman's hormonal cycle can vary widely, especially under duress.  Any recent stresses; change of diet, change of birth control method (chemical particularly), lack of rest, relationship issues, exercise, meds, diseases and so on can affect your body and that will reflect on your menses in different ways.  Heavier, lighter, early, late- you may even miss one!  So relax a little ;) 

The stick can give false answers, especially if it's too early or you are skipping a period.  Most manufacturers of those products suggest re-testing in 3 days.  hCG is a hormone that is measurable within about 10-14 days of conception with home products and most of the times the GYNs will rely on them. If you are still unsure you can get tested at a lab, a local women's clinic, your gyn office or health care provider.  Let your fingers do the walking across the local yellow pages.

One doctor told me it shoudl be operated as they could move and go in some duct while others told me not too. the glabladder is not full at all, there are just few, day 10 little stones. Do you have experience about it? suggestion?thanks","The most common disorder of the biliary tract (gallbladder and bile ducts) is gallstones. Why and how gallstones form is not fully understood, but it is thought that in some cases an abnormality in function causes the gallbladder to remove an excessive amount of water from the bile so that some of its constituents can no longer remain in solution. Gallstones occur very frequently in developed countries and may be associated with eating a diet that is high in fat and refined carbohydrates and low in fiber. As many as 10-20 percent of the U.S. population over the age of forty have gallstones, but only in a minority do symptoms occur. If gallstones are found by chance on an X-ray taken for some other reason it is standard practice to leave them alone if they are causing no symptoms, since the risk of developing problems is slightly less than the risk from a major operation. However, if a patient with asymptomatic gallstones is having an abdominal operation for another reason, the gallbladder may be removed at the same time. The problems that gallstones can give rise to are various and include cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder), choledocholithiasis (gallstones in the common bile duct), and cholangitis (infection of the bile ducts), pancreatitis, and gallstone ileus (obstruction of the intestines by a gallstone).
Make sure you eat a low fat diet, lose weight and exercise. This will help prevent the need for an operation. As a nurse personally I would try the diet with the tablets you have first THEN the operation if dieting didn't help.

Get a few loved ones together and confront her.  Then have a cleaning party.  Most people when confronted will be reasonable enough to let you do it. She'll probably be biting her nails as you do, but ultimately will be relieved.

There might be complications/ severe pain after surgery. Is it natural to suffer from severe throat infections (itching, pain, ear-ache) due to a tonsils problem? I am also not able to work in an air-conditioned office due to my tonsils problem. My ears start aching and I have trouble breathing. Will these problems go away after surgery? My doctor seems to think so but I have doubts. Anybody been through such a problem? Please help!! Thanks","1. You will feel tired following the procedure because of the anesthetic and pain medication you have been given.

2. You will have some soreness of the throat. The pain may get worse before it gets better. It is important to take your pain medication as prescribed by your surgeon. With the sore throat you may not feel like taking anything by mouth. Even so, you must drink fluids. A cool mist humidifier can be soothing for your throat.

3. You may experience pain in your ears. This is common during the first week.

4. You will have bad breath from scabs where the tonsils were removed. These scabs fall off in about 7 to 10 days, and your breath odor will return to normal. Do not gargle, as this will hurt and may cause bleeding. Rinse your mouth with any antiseptic mouthwash.

5. Diet: eating may not be possible right away. The first day you should favour: clear fluids such as water, apple juice, Gatorade, and popsicles. Avoid: citrus juices and carbonated beverages (colas) because they may cause increased pain and throat irritation. After a few days start trying foods that are easy to swallow. Favour: Jello, soft noodles, warm broth, puddings, yogurt, and ice cream. Avoid: steamy, hot, or spicy foods or hard, crunchy foods.

6. Avoid constipation, be sure you include plenty of liquids in your diet. You may require a mild laxative.

7. You may return to work in about 1-2 weeks. Most adults need about 1 week to recuperate and return to a more normal diet.


What should I avoid following my tonsillectomy?

1. You are not to drive a motor vehicle for 24-48 hours. Follow your physician's instruction regarding any alternate or additional restrictions.

2. You must have a responsible adult accompany you home and stay with you over night.

3. No beer or alcohol for 24 hours.

4. Do not sign legal documents or make important decisions for 24 hours.

5. Do not operate machinery or perform tasks requiring skill, coordination, or judgement within 24 hours after your procedure.

6. Do no participate in any physical fitness or contact sports for 10 days to 2 weeks.

When should I call the doctor?

1. If you have bleeding other than blood tinged saliva, bleeding more than 2 tablespoons of blood or you vomit blood, please inform your surgeon at once. If you cannot reach your surgeon, go to the Emergency Department of the nearest hospital.

2. You may have a slight fever (38ï¿½C or 100ï¿½F) for a couple of days. If fever persists for more than 48 hours and or you develop chills, contact your doctor.

3. Should you develop any other problems or have any concerns, please contact your doctor at his/her office or go to the Emergency Department.",tonsillectomy,25-34 years old,,,,,,,There might be complications/ severe pain after surgery,tonsillectomy,,,,,,,,,Will these problems go away after surgery?,tonsillectomy,,,My doctor seems to think so but I have doubts.,tonsillectomy,,,Any suggestions/ precautions/advise,Please help!!,,,Anybody been through such a problem,,No,,,

The symptoms that you have described occur in many diseases or conditions, so it is not safe to say here 'its an STD' or 'its a UTI'.  It does take Cipro a little while to work.  The most important thing is to not stop taking it if you start feeling better.  If you do not take the full course of the antibiotic, the bacteria causing your infection may become immune to it and become harder to kill.  So even if you start feeling better within a couple days, continue the antibiotic as prescribed for the full course, unless you contact your doctor and they tell you otherwise.

The abdominal pain is the ligaments stretching but if it severe, this is worrisome. What concerns me is the shoulder pain and the pain when walking and using the bathroom. That should not be happening and is a sign of ectopic pregnancy (I have had two ectopics). If I were in your shoes, I would go to the emergency room immediately, so that they can do an ultrasound.

You can have one and see something in the uterus as early as 4 and a half weeks (I did). Because you are six weeks, they should see a heartbeat.

My Doctor advised me to continue taking Insulin 30/70 through out my life. Most people are advising me that Insulin will affect the nerves in future and taking pills is enough. Now it is normal in urine and sugar and fluctuates now and then and not so serious.But my Doc strictly recommending me to take 20ml.insulin in the morning and 10ml. in the night and no pills. I am confused in this aspect whether i have to continue lifelong or not. Still i never failed to take injection everyday in the morn and night. Kindly guide me whether taking insulin continuously will spoil my life.,"There are two types of diabetes, they are called type 1 and type 2.
Type 1 diabetes is usually detected at an early age, my daughter was 9.  The pancreas makes the part of your blood that carries the sugar to the muscle.  When the pancreas stops making this, the muscle has to look somewhere else for sugar to make energy.  During this time, all the sugar that you eat stays in your blood  (this is what gives your the high numbers), also  when the muscle is getting is energy from other places it puts toxins into your blood which come out in the urine  (this is what gives you high ketone levels)

It is very important to follow what the doctor tells you!!! You need to write down every time you test your bood and what the sugar level was.  Normal blood sugar should not go above 140.  If the amount of insulin that you are taking is not keeping your blood sugar down, make an appointment with your doctor right away and have them change your dosage.  Never try to change the dosage yourself!!  

Your doctor may also referr you to a diabetic clinic.  These people work closely with monitoring insulin dosages as well as teaching good nutrition and meal planning.

Don't get discouraged, it can take time to get your insulin dosage set right for you.  It took my daughter a year and a half, which also included changing to all different types of insulin, different times of day for shots. You are not alone, there are so many wonderful people and support groups just waiting to help, all you have to do is ask.  (That goes for me too, if you ever need to talk, send me an email).

Getting back to the rest of your question:  
Only type 2 diabetes can be controlled by pills and diet. And last of all, and maybe most inportant;  taking insulin continuously can only SAVE your life.

If you want more detailed information about diabetes, search for American Diabetes on the web or ask your doctor.

I wish you all the best!!!!!!!!!Please let me know how you are doing.",Insulin for Diabetes,,,,whether taking insulin continuously will spoil my life.,Insulin for Diabetes,,,whether taking insulin continuously will spoil my life.,Insulin for Diabetes,,,,,,,,,,,I am confused in this aspect whether i have to continue lifelong or not.,Insulin for Diabetes,,,,,Whether i have to continue life long?,Kindly guide me whether taking insulin continuously will spoil my life.,Kindly guide me whether taking insulin continuously will spoil my life.,,,,"Yes: my daughter was 9.

The dark blood could mean you may have endometriosis in addition to the cysts. Endo is also known as having 'chocolate cysts'. These may have been bursting, or your ovarian cysts have been bursting. Hence all the pain and bleeding you have endured.

Headaches and everything! And...it probably is in your head. The most common cause of headaches is poor vision, aka you need glasses. If you had cancer you would have blurry vision, pass out for no reason, have trouble with balance, and spit up blood. If you don't have any of these problems, try not to worry! If the docs said that you are ok, you probably are. When I had this anxiety I went into the hospital and actually had an MRI done...nothing. Try not to worry, and talk about your fears with other people - that can help. Good luck.

Not on either side but more all the way across, from one side to another. It has just been off and on til today it seems to be a little more. It's not horrible pain but it is noticeable and there are times that there are sharp pains with the constant pain...anyone have any idea what it might be...just started all of sudden and it's not time for my period. I have a doctors appt on Tuesday but just thought I would see if anyone had any ideas what it might be..oh and also want to add, not sure if it is related but I have also had changes in my bowel moments, been having a lot of gas and also having and/or feeling like have to urinate alot more then normal.

Tamitha","Acute pelvic pain is pain that starts over a short period of time anywhere from a few minutes to a few days. This type of pain is often a warning sign that something is wrong and should be evaluated promptly. 
Pelvic pain can be caused by an infection or inflammation. An infection doesn't have to affect the reproductive organs to cause pelvic pain. Pain caused by the bladder, bowel, or appendix can produce pain in the pelvic region; diverticulitis, irritable bowel syndrome, kidney or bladder stones, as well as muscle spasms or strains are some examples of non-reproductive causes of pelvic or lower abdominal pain. Other causes of pelvic pain can include pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), vaginal infections, vaginitis, and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). All of these require a visit to your healthcare provider who will take a medical history, and do a physical exam which may include diagnostic testing. 

Women who have ovarian cysts may experience sharp pain if a cyst leaks fluid or bleeds a little, or more severe, sharp, and continuous pain when a large cyst twists. Fortunately, most small cysts will dissolve without medical intervention after 2 or 3 menstrual cycles; however large cysts and those that don't rectify themselves after a few months may require surgery to remove the cysts. 

An ectopic pregnancy is one that starts outside the uterus, usually in one of the fallopian tubes. Pain caused by an ectopic pregnancy usually starts on one side of the abdomen soon after a missed period, and may include spotting or vaginal bleeding. Ectopic pregnancies can be life-threatening if medical intervention is not sought immediately. The fallopian tubes can burst and cause bleeding in the abdomen, if left untreated. In some cases surgery is required to remove the affected fallopian tube.",pelvic pain?,35-44 years old,Female,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,.anyone have any idea what it might be,,,,,,Not applicable,,,

My wife appears to have this disorder, according to the licensed therapist.  We are going through a divorce that appears to be caused by this condition.  We have two young kids - ages 5 and 7.  She does not see the destruction and harm she is doing.  She really thinks everything is okay.  I've always thought it was ""normal"" for her.   All the experts - therapists, lawyers, priests - have all told us - especially her - that she has no grounds for a divorce and she is acting irrational.  Living in CA, a no-fault divorce state, nothing can stop her from disolving the marriage.  However, a mental disorder can stop her from getting any form of visitation or custody of the kids.

When i eat only veg based products I have minimal flare up?

Has anyone else found a similar intolerance in them or relatives? It seem silly to me, can only be certain Nutrients that are in meat products?????

THANKS","Hello,

I had Ulcerative Colitis & Proctitis six years ago and cured myself without western medications. Proctitis & ulcerative colitis are both serious digestive conditions which affect the colon and bowel. Crohns is a chronic digestive condition which also affects the colon, all of these conditions respond very positively to a process of food elimination.

YES! MEAT !! is a no! no! if you have Crohns why? because meat is extremely hard work for the colon to deal with and so removing meat & meat products from your diet will definately help your colon & condition (symptoms of the Crohns).

**NOTE: I could write pages & pages on this topic but dont have the time or space. However please see my website it has LOTS of information which you would find of value? I hope?

It's not even with just school subjects, I used to be a avid computer game player, and now I'm just very uninterested in it.

Go to your doctor for a professional diagnosis so you can get the treatment your need, and don't be afraid of any of the therapy or medications if they help you in the long run.

The kind of depression you seem to have symptoms of usually doesn't seem to have any obvious cause and so can go on undetected for months or even years making your life sad and purposeless for no apparent reason.

41,2193522,HPV vaccine for males?,Recently I heard about a vaccine for many strains of the HPV virus being given to women. I'm wondering about whether this vaccine is available for males as well. Surely cervical cancer caused by HPV is a problem for women but HPV can also cause cancer of the genitals and anus in men as well. Shouldn't this vaccine be given to everyone instead of being just available for women? Is this vaccine experimental or is it proven to be safe and effective? Thank you.,"I agree, the vaccine should be given to males. Males transmit it  too and do on occasion have problems from it. However, at this time it is only approved for females and suggested for girls between the ages of 9- 26 BEFORE they are sexually active. It  is considered effective for certain strains of HPV (16 and 18 are two) for up to 5 years. I guess time will tell if the shots hold up any longer than that.

Clinical trials for Gardasil was performed on girls between the ages of 16-23, therefore they have not tested it in men. The FDA will not approve it for men until it has been tested on them. I believe in time they will work on a vaccine for men, but right now the concern is with high risk strains of the virus that are linked to cervical and genital cancers in women, HPV effects men totally different. There is an extremely rare chance or penile cancer, and anal cancer in men who have anal sex, but overall HPV causes far less problems in men at this time. 
 
I have also heard that the next big thing in HPV is a vaccine of sorts for women that already have the virus, this would be awesome! Maybe men will be considered in the near future too.

now she will re gain part of the lost functions because after a stroke, edema of the brain develops and is maximal a couple of days after the onset of stroke, this edema will cause even more functional loss but it is reversible, with time (weeks) the edema subsides and the neurons return to normal function. anyway, she still has a dead part of the brain but other parts of the brain can take the function of the dead tissue and so she may regain more functions and that's done by physiotherapy. rehabilitaion is very important for her.

Birth control helps a LOT of women, and I wouldn't necessarily give up on it (unless you are trying to get pregnant, obviously) but it is not a universal cure for what ails you.  It conceals your symptoms... it does not treat the underlying issue.

Unless you have a diagnosis for why your periods are so difficult (Endometriosis, PID, Ovarian Cysts, Fibroids... lots of options, and it's not possible to diagnose over the web) then your doctor should not be just dismissing your problems with ""birth control"" as if that is the only cure.

12,1274118,"Obesity in todays youth. The parents fault, the schools, or....both?","I think that since some schools are limiting PE to only once a week or removing it all together they are partly to blame.  Some parents buy alot of fatty foods for their kids. Some don't care of their kids spend hours playing video games.

Why do parents deny they are at fault?  The show Honey We are Killing the Kids.  Can anyone say eye opener.  Children spend less the 8 hours at school.  They are at home at least 1/3 of the time, enough for parents to do what they are supposed to.  Raise healthy kids.

is this a phimosis??
and..., when do boys usually have their prepuce retracted?
thanks very much..........","Phimosis is a medical condition in which the foreskin of the penis of an uncircumcised male cannot be fully retracted. The word derives from the Greek phimos (_____, ""muzzle""). The term is confusing because it is used to denote both a physiologic stage of development (i.e., not a disease), and a pathologic condition (i.e., a condition that causes problems for a person). Elasticity and ambiguity of definition are especially common when referring to infants. Conflicting incidence reports and widely varying post-neonatal circumcision rates reflect looseness in the diagnostic criteria 2,3. Phimosis has become a topic of contention in circumcision debates (see 14 and Medical analysis of circumcision).

Phimosis in most but not all infants is physiologic rather than pathologic, whereas phimosis in older children and adults is more often pathologic than physiologic. Some have suggested that physiologic infantile phimosis be referred to as developmental nonretractility of the foreskin to more clearly distinguish this normal stage of development from pathologic forms of phimosis 10.

Make the appointment first, then make sure to write down ALL the food that he has had during the time period between making the appointment and going to it.

I would not recommend specifically giving him foods that you think he may be allergic to... a true allergic reaction gets worse the more times you are exposed to it, so the outcome of giving him something he may be allergic to could be very harmful.

Asthma also has to do with repressed fear and anger/resentment. I use this technique with resounding success http://www.jentleearthhealing.com/tft.html If you like the look of this treatment then let me know and I will put you in touch with a practitioner near you. In most every case where I deal with this emotional/energetic side as well and release the blockage, there is a very rapid and almost permanent recovery so do NOT underestimate this as being causal and valid.

We have tried various options . But for one reason or the other he keeps on aborting the plans.He develops anxiety, as soon as we try to finalize a plan. He has gone thru depressive phase as well. he is on 2mg respideral these days. He was prescribed various other medications in the beginning as well . Presently he is practicaly not doing anything. He also regulary visits Psychiatrist. Her overall assessment is that he is a kind of Schizophrtenic. He also addicterd on Cannabis.
Please advise how can we develop/incease his interest in a job/small business at least.","Tough situation as lack of motivation is a symptom of schizophrenia. It sounds as if he may have a somewhat complex symptom picture including both depression and schizophrenia symptoms. Don't know what he was like before developing symptoms of psychosis, but if he has always tended to be shy, or amotivated then schizophrenia makes these traits more pronounced.

At any rate, it may be that making the jump to a job or studies is too big a jump to make right now. It is also often difficult for you as a parent to be the one who motivates your adult child with a mental illness. I would suggest looking in your community for a community program that would involve your son in some activities that might be a precursor to job/studies. Psychosocial rehabilitation, day treatment, and other rehabilitation programs can be quite helpful. Call your local mental health association, ask your psychiatrist, or call the local mental health center for a referral to a rehabilitation program. 

Hang in there as this is a long-term problem with which you must deal. Ideally you would like to have your child work his way to more independance, but it might be a slow journey. Get some help from people who know how to do this. You might also find out if there is a support group for parents with schizophrenic children--these groups can be very helpful in providing information and support.

What is this a sign of, and I know i should see a doctor, but like many others..thar fear is hauting me.","First off, take a deep breath and relax.  You are ok.  Next, call your doctor.  This is exactly the sort of stuff your ob-gyn is trained to handle, and will understand your situation.  Having PCS makes your periods a bit screwy as your hormones don't really act quite the way they should.  

Your doctor can evaluate you to find out 1) why you are clotting and to see if anything else is wrong with you (thyroid issues can make things go squirly too).

You are feeling woozy and tired most likely from the blood loss.  Losing a lot of blood can make you dehydrated, and anemic.  So rest, drink water, take a pain killer for the cramps and call your doctor.  

Good luck.  I know how scary this can seem, I have been through it myself, and for me it turned out to be nothing - some water, and a few weeks or iron pills for the anemia and I was fine.

0,3672031,Tremendous pain in head and nerves while flying?,"Hi,

I feel heavy pain while I fly in plane. This happens especially when the plane starts landing. I feel the pain in the skull in the upper part of skull over eyes. The pain is unbearable and I feel tremendous pressure in my head and nerves start heavily stretching. I feel that the nerves in the head will blast. Please note that I feel heavy pain in the area near to eyes both sides of the face. This happens only at the time of landing and not the take-off. I am really worried of this situation and I am scared of flying now. I've felt this type of pain eight times of out of nine times I flied. Please provide some suggestion what kind of problem it could be. Please let me know if you have any idea about what kind of problem I may have or if any more details regarding to my problem.","Airplanes are pressurized, but they aren't pefect.  Pressure inside the plane probably drops just a hair below atmospheric pressure as the plane ascends, and once again increases back to atmospheric pressure as it descends.

Your head, especially the face, is full of air pockets called sinuses.  In addition to the sinuses that you see people complaining about in TV ads (i.e. the maxillary sinuses), there are the ethmoid sinuses, sphenoid sinuses, and frontal sinuses, plus others that I don't believe commmunicate with the external environment.  All of these sinuses are connected with the external environment via openings into your nose (you cannot see them, but an ENT physician deals with them all the time).  These openings allow the air pressure in the sinuses to equilibrate with the environment.  Furthermore, your middle ears are connected to the external environment via the Eustachian tubes which open into the nasopharynx.  Similarly, the pressure in the middle ear equilibrates with the pressure of the environment.

Sometimes, however, the openings of these sinuses in the nose can become obstructed for various reasons--infection being one of them.  Same situation with the Eustachain tubes.  I recall, as a child, having severe pain in my ears while on a plane.

This is where my knowledge is really lacking, but I'll give it a try.  I do know that middle ear infections are often very painful because of pressure accumilation due to obstructed Eustachian tubes (either obstructed or inflamed to the point where they no longer drain well into the nasopharynx).  Presumably the same applies to the sinuses in your face.  Inability to equilibrate with the environment, even if it's low pressure, may translate into pain.

You might want to ask your ENT about it, though.",pain in head and nerves,,,,,,,,I feel heavy pain while I fly in plane,pain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Please let me know if you have any idea about what kind of problem,I am scared of flying now,,,,,"Yes: You might want to ask your ENT about it, though.",,,

And Why is my voice lower?,"OK I suspect chronic tonsillitis, They're swollen red, with holes in them, and they produce tonsil stones, they've been this way for about 6 years now, and now they're separated from the sides of my throat as though they're dangling, and could fall of eventually.

12,3689869,Congestive Heart Failure Life Expectancy?,"What is the average life expectancy of someone who is in stage 3 of Congestive Heart Failure.  I have a friend who seems to not care.  He is a 47 year old male who drinks daily, smokes 1 pack of cigarettes a day and consumes a high sodium diet.  He has extreme fatigue, shortness of breath and nausea.  His back heart muscle has been diagnosed as extremely weak and he does not take his heart meds.  I'm concerned for his children and would like to know what to expect.","As someone who, like your friend, developed heart failure in middle age (I was 49 at the time), I can tell you that his life expectancy is directly related to how well he takes care of himself.  And that, of course, is bad news for your friend.

As you realize, he is doing everything wrong.  The shortness of breath would be relieved if he lost weight, gave up the cigarettes and dropped the sodium.  I don't know what medications he was prescribed, but probably at least one of them would help him shed the fluid that may be getting into his lungs and making it harder for him to breathe.  

It's no wonder he is always fatigued.  How would anyone feel if they have reduced heart function and reduced lung capacity?

As to his other meds, there are wonderful drugs now that can lighten the load on his heart and make it easier for the heart--the part that's still funtioning--to do its job.  If he doesn't take them, he is overstressing the working portion of his heart as it tries to do the job of the entire organ.  It can't, at least not without help.

The nausea is a very worrisome symptom.  That one suggests angina, which sometimes comes out that way.  His poor heart, overworked as it is, may be sending out distress signals which are perceived as nausea.  

Depending on how much alcohol his is consuming, daily drinking may or may not be a problem.  One or two drinks a day (NO MORE, and NO doubles) actually seems to benefit the heart.  But some people think that if one is okay, four must be great.  It's not.  The beneficial aspects of alcohol completely reverse if you have more than about 2 drinks (just one for a woman).

Overall, this man needs to go back to his doctor and lay all his cards on the table.  Could he be depressed and ""giving up""?  That is very common with heart patients.  He needs to tell his doctor *everything* he is doing and not doing, and why.

I believe that patients have rights, and so does your friend.  But he also has children, which means he has a responsibility to be around for them until they are well established on their own.  If he lets himself die while they are still young, they will never fully forgive him.  What's worse, he will have missed out on seeing them grow up, which one of the best parts of life.

25,605784,"Seeing doctor on the 26th, can anyone research and collect what could be wrong with me?","Background:

Dec 04 I was diagnosed with a 43 lb ovarian tumour on one of my ovaries, surgery removed the tumour as well as half of my ovary.

Symptoms:
Now I'm experiencing all of the same symptoms as last year, except now my breasts are hurting - my aunt tells me my lymph nodes are swollen. They are very firm and bumpy, very sore.
My legs are absolutely killing me. They ache and cramp.
Where my uterus is located is very firm and is enlarged, it pulses from time to time and feels as though it's cramping (my period is due on or around the 27th).
I feel exhausted, I can sleep for well over 12 hours, I feel drained - this is one of the symptoms I had last year too.
My appetite has definitely grown, another symptom I had last year.
I feel sick to my stomach.

What else could this possibly be? 
Would my breasts and legs hurt sooo much if I have another cyst/tumour growing on my ovary?","i know that people usually have several cysts, but only one starts growing and when it becomes dangerously big they remove it. but the reason why it started growing remain. so that near one which was small can start growing too. so i won't be surprise if u have another cyst grown.

26,436504,Young IBS?,"My 11-year old daughter has been experiancing some constipation and problems with her bowel movements for the past few months. I've taken her to the doctor, because it sounds like she's inherited my IBS. The doctor said that it's too early to diagnose IBS, but to give her this stuff called 'Mirilax' which seems to be doing okay. My question is, is it possible she's inherited my IBS, or should I just ignore my worry?","It is not too early to diagnose IBS in your daughter and I think you're probably right.  The Mirilax will only help with elimination and not get to root of problem I'm sure you realize.  

There appears to be four main causes of IBS: stress, insufficient intake of dietary fiber, food allergies, and meals too high in sugar. Stress increases the motility (the rhythmic contractions of the intestine that propel food through the digestive tract) of the colon and leads to abdominal pain and irregular bowel functions.

Dietary fiber promotes proper colon function. Patients with constipation are much more likely to respond to dietary fiber than those with diarrhea. Increasing intake of dietary fiber from fruit and vegetable sources rather than cereal sources may offer more benefit to some individuals.

Food allergy as a cause of IBS has been recognized since the early 1900s. More recent studies have shown the majority of patients with IBS (approximately two-thirds) have at least one food allergy, and some have multiple allergies. The most common allergens are dairy products (forty to forty-four percent) and grains (forty to sixty percent). Many patients have noted marked clinical improvement when using elimination diets (see FOOD ALLERGY for further discussion).

Meals high in refined sugar can contribute to IBS by decreasing intestinal motility. When blood sugar levels rise too rapidly, the normal rhythmic contractions of the gastrointestinal tract slow down and in some portions stop altogether. A diet high in refined sugar may be the most important contributing factor to IBS being such a common condition in the United States.

What nutritional supplements should I take for Irritable Bowel Syndrome?

Foundation Supplements. There are three products from Natural Factors that I think are critical in supporting good health:

    * MultiStart (age and gender specific multiple vitamin and mineral formulas). Follow label instructions.
    * Enriching Greens - a great tasting ""greens drink"" containing highly concentrated ""greens"" like chlorella, spirulina, wheat grass juice, barley grass juice, etc., and herbal extracts. Take one serving (one tablespoon) in 8 ounces of water daily.
    * RxOmega-3 Factors - A true pharmaceutical grade fish oil supplement. Take two capsules daily.

PGX with Mulberry Extract from Natural Factors. PGX is a special soluble fiber blend that is primarily used to help control after meal elevations in blood sugar. However, it is extremely useful as well as a gastrointestinal tract tonic in patients with IBS. Take 2-4 capsules 5 to 15 minutes before meals.

RevitalX is a high potency multi-nutrient powdered drink mix formula from Natural Factors. The product was developed by Michael Lyon, M.D., and specifically engineered to be an excellent source of important nutrients to support the gastrointestinal lining and aid detoxification. It is an excellent source of hypoallergenic vegetarian protein that we have termed GoldPeptides along with specific nutritional, probiotic, and herbal support to the digestive system. Take one serving daily.

Peppermint Oil Complex with Oregano Oil from Natural Factors provides volatile oils from peppermint, oregano, and caraway seed oil in an enteric-coated capsule so that it does not break down in the stomach but is instead delivered to the small and large intestine. Preparations containing peppermint oil in enteric-coated capsules have been shown to be very effective in IBS. Take one or two capsules three times daily twenty minutes before meals.

Probiotic supplements supplying Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacteria species are very important in IBS. Take a product that will provide 5-10 billion live bacteria daily. We have gotten a great deal of positive feedback on BB536 a special Bifidobacteria in the RevitalX Probiotic with BB536 from Natural Factors.

29,1496557,Not ovulating and TTC?,"My husband have been trying for a year to get pregnant. I have had to miscarraiges Dec 05 and June 06. We have sex every other night, someone told me that helps build up the sperm. I have been taking OPK to see when I am ovulating and I have not had a positive in 3 months. Last month I had a hermage cyst on my left ovary. I have another appointment with my doctor this Friday since I am still having some ovarian discomfort.

My question is what are my options on getting pregnant? If I don't have PCOS would I still be put on Clomid? Do I want to be on Clomid? Anyone who has had similar issues or knowledge please help.

Thanks!","I was recently diagnosed with PCOS.  I work in a gyne office, so I have been lucky in not having to pay for my testing.  Before I was diagnosed, I was on depo for 8 years.  I had my last shot on November 3, 2005.  On November 6, 2006 I went to work, and asked if I could get a sono to see how bad the supposed cysts that I had on my ovaries were.  I did not have a period the whole time I was on depo, and was starting to get anxious about my period not starting.  My husband I are ttc.  When they did the sono, I did not have any cysts.  This was a huge relief.  I don't know if it was the decreased stress or what, but that night my period started.  At first I thought that this was from the sono because it was vaginal, but I went to work the next day and asked.  It was finally my period!  I am now on a waiting list to see an endocrinologist about the PSOC, but I still do not know for sure if I really have it.  My sono, and blood work have both been within normal limits, so who knows?   I am a bit hesitant to take Clomid, because fertility drugs do have risks.  I have read that glucophage is supposed to help prevent miscarriage if you have PCOS.  It sounds like the problem is not getting pregnant, it is staying that way.

30,1588261,People with thyroid problems do not lose wt. same way as others!?,"I've seen some people say that it's all mathmatical/biological. The calories you put in vs. the calories burned. Yes, that works for a NORMAL person. But the people who say that thyroid problem or not, is WRONG. 

Those people need to get more educated about auto-immune diseases. When someone has a thryoid problem such as hypothyroidism (and no, this doesn't happen to ALL of them, but most) is that their metabolism slows or even shuts down almost completely depending on how severe their problem is. No, pills don't aways ""cure"" people and then they drop weight. The more calories resricted for someone with hypothyroidism, the MORE wt. they gain. This has been found over and over again. They need to eat more to speed their metabolism up. Exercise isn't always easy when the thyroid can make you feel as if you just went through chemotherapy. So get educated people! LOL

Who agrees? Disagrees? (be nice) and comment if you like...","I totally agree. While I'm not a person with a thyroid problem I do know several people who have it and it is hard for them to loose weight. Lots of people are quick to jump at the idea that because they (the person with the thyroid problem) can't loose weight that its because they eat to much/ dont exercise. etc. and have very harsh coments towards these people. And that simply isn't true.

The pain is from a vacuum effect in your ear from which pus is leaking and your ear is not draining properly.

The stress of taking care of your family, the pregnancy and whatever else going on in your life is taking its tole on your body, your mind and your baby.

The most important suggestion I have is to talk to your doctor. There are medications that are approved for use during pregnancy. But even if you don't want to take medication, just talking to your doctor can help. You could also see about getting a referal for a therapist who can help you talk through your stress and develop healthy ways for coping with it.

Other ways to deal with depression include confiding in a good friend, keeping a journal, focusing on something positive and sometimes even just sitting down and having a good cry.

What you are feeling is okay and understandable. But in order to continue caring for your family and to ensure the health of the baby you are carrying - I strongly urge you to see your doctor sooner rather than later.","stress, borderline depression",,Female,,,,,,"I can barely help myself.
