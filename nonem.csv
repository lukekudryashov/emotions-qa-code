Yesterday you were out shooting some baskets or maybe playing some touch football when you made this sudden turn and heard a soft ""pop."" Soft popping sounds don't usually get you excited, but this one came from your knee. The next thing you knew, your hands were wrapped around that rascal and your eyes were filled with tears of pain.
Today you woke up with swelling, tenderness, radiating pain, and perhaps some discoloration and loss of motion.
What kind of damage could have occurred? Well, there are basically three common forms of destruction to choose from: torn cartilage, a torn ligament, or both.
What should you do about it: That's easy. Put it on ice and go to a doctorï¿½today.
I got this ^^^^ information from google and it pretty much describes my situation with my knee. But still I don't have any further information and I would really really appreciate some help from a doctor who knows about this...","Sounds like you could have injured your ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) or your meniscus. Both are internal structures of the knee which likely explains the swelling of the knee. Sometimes you will experience instablility, locking, catching, etc. 
 Right know you should ice the knee and keep it elevated. Within the next week or so I would recommend seeing an orthopedist or primary care sports med physician. There is a good chance they will order an MRI of the knee to determine if something was indeed torn. If so, then options are surgery or physical therapy. Which you option you and the doc choose depends on your age, level of activity, extent of injury, etc.
  I hope this helps.","swelling, tenderness, radiating pain, and perhaps some discoloration and loss of motion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I got this ^^^^ information from google and it pretty much describes my situation with my knee.

Thanks guys. <3M","Ask your doctor if he/she can prescribe you phenergen, to help with the nausea and vomiting which, by the way, is a common side affect to both of those medications. 

I'm really sorry about the pleurisy it can be extremely painful. If you are experiencing any ittching that is sometimes associated with it then you could take OTC Benadryl and that would serve double duty as it would not only help the itching, but also the nausea. 

As always, consult your physician and pharmacist before talking any medications, and I wish you the best.

---------------------------------
Edit:
Regarding the latter posters and allergic reactions:
It's a common misconception that nausea and vomiting is a sign of an allergic reaction, it's not, it's a normal however undesirable side effect of the drug. Most drugs have such side effects along with headache, dizzyness and somnolence. Allergic reactions are caused when the body's  immune system attacks a normally harmless substance (the allergen). The immune system calls upon a protective antibody called immunoglobulin E or IgE to fight these invading substances. The large IgE release ends up causing mast cells to be injured or irritated and they release a variety of strong chemicals, including histamine, into the tissues and blood. This causes the itching, swelling, and fluid leaking from nearby cells. These chemicals cause the familiar signs of an allergic reaction that we all recognize,  itching, airway and throat tightening, hay fever and allergic rhinitis to name just a few.",Nausea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Is it the Percoset?

keep the area clean, and allow a lot of fresh air to get to it. you can use all kinds of antiseptics to clean it, some of them even include procainamide (allergy?) that sets down the pain (one brand is called baktine, you can buy it at cvs). if you still have that much pain, there is probably still some nail in there penetrating your tissue = infection + pain. if that's the case it wont go away by itself. you have two options to get it out of there: go to the specialist who is expensive, or go to any general surgeon who will cut out a ""triangle"" on the left/right side of your toe nail (painful at first, but also works).",ingrown toenails,,,,A specialist with my insurance is really expensive and I dont have much extra money.,ingrown toenail,"A few days ago, i was able to see the ingrown nail and I clipped it.

    plzzzzzzz reply me if u r a docter or good adviser","Conditions associated with pectus excavatum include Marfan syndrome, Poland syndrome, and Pouter pigeon breast:

Marfan syndrome

The Marfan syndrome is a connective tissue disorder. Connective tissue provides substance and support to tendons, ligaments, blood vessel walls, cartilage, heart valves and many other structures. In the Marfan syndrome, the chemical makeup of the connective tissue isn't normal. As a result, many of these structures aren't as stiff as they should be.

The Marfan syndrome is inherited and affects many parts of the body. There's no single conclusive test for diagnosing it, but people who have it often have many similar traits. Besides perhaps having heart problems, people with the Marfan syndrome are often tall and thin. They also may have slender, tapering fingers, long arms and legs, curvature of the spine and eye problems. Sometimes the Marfan syndrome is so mild that few (if any) symptoms exist. In the most severe cases, which are rare, life-threatening problems may occur at any age.

Poland syndrome

Poland syndrome consists of a deficiency of subcutaneous fat and muscles on one side of the body. It may include underdevelopment of the arm, hand, and fingers on the same side, and may be associated with other conditions such as Moebius syndrome or Klippel-Feil syndrome. The right side of the body is affected twice as often as the left.

It is difficult to determine how many individuals are affected by Poland syndrome, since mild cases may go unnoticed or be misdiagnosed. One study estimated that it may occur in 1 in 30,000 individuals. Poland syndrome does seem to affect males more commonly than females.

Symptoms
Poland syndrome has several distinctive symptoms:

    * Chest muscle deformities - absence of the pectoralis minor and the breastbone part of the pectoralis major
    * Undedevelopment or absence of breast or nipple on the affected side
    * Patchy absence of hair under the arm on the affected side 

Additional symptoms on the affected side may include:

    * Underdeveloped or missing ribs
    * Underdeveloped arm, hand, and fingers
    * Abnormally short, webbed fingers
    * Small, elevated scapula (shoulder bone), called Sprengel deformity",increse my weght.,,,,last 3 years i havn't any kind of growth in my weight.,weight,,,,,"last 3 month my docter doing ,getting money & give some tablets.no more i can  wait ...",my docter,,,,,,,,, but it makes only some pus pimple. ~~~,2000 extra colores from nuts per each day,my doctor said weight management is not depent on PE.,my docter,,,Yes: any disease had such a symptoms??????or are these the hormon disease?,,,,,,Other: NA,,,

40,4334189,Is weight loss surgery healthy?,"That is the best way I have found to phrase this question.  I tried asking this question yesterday but I do not think I phrased it right so I did not get the answers I was looking for.

I am curious as to it being unhealthy compared to anorexia.  I understand that anorexia is a mental disorder.  I also understand that weight loss surgery is not.  But is the limited food intake comparable to anorexia?  I understand that a large person cannot be anorectic, because being anorectic involves having distorted image of ones self.  Isn't rapid weight loss a sign of anorexia?  And isn't the rapid weight loss a result of not being able to eat, either physically or emotionally, wouldn't that be considered anorexia also?

I am not trying to be disrespectful, I am just trying to understand this.  I have struggled with an eating disorder in the past, and I have  friends who  had weight loss surgery.  I see them acting the same ways as I have in the past.  I want to notice if something is wrong.","Weight Loss surgery is not healthy and it should only be used for the morbidly obese (in other words if they dont get the surgery they will die in five years). Too many people are getting the gastric bypass surgeries as an easy fix. And the doctors are eager to give them since they and the hospital makes big bucks. They say they council these men and women but they still offer them so much more that the fear is subdued.

Here is the problems with Weight Loss Surgery:
You could die on the table
You could die later from complications
You could die from malnourishment
You can have many illnesses from lack of nutition
You dont do well in pregnancy since it is hard for the baby to get 
      the nourishment it needs
Your stomach can stretch back out over time if you overeat
For a long time you can only eat a Tablespoon of food at a time
      eat more than that or rich food and you throw up. Many 
      surgery patients throw up alot.
You are on supplements the rest of your life
This surgery is irreversible, so if you dont like your life after
       you dont have a choice. No going back.
These patients lose all joy surrounding food (parties, dinner out)
This surgery is not natural for your body.

These are just a few reasons to find another way. Anorexia is not the answer either as it also has many health risks. The best way to lose weight is to eat less, exercise, eat more natural diet, and be happy (sadness and depression cause weight gain).

Hoodia is a good natural pill (derived from cactus in Africa) to supress the appetite to get the fat off. As the fat comes off you will naturally eat less and better. You can do Weight Watchers as it is the most tested of all plans and it works. Never try to lose more than 2-3 lbs per week or you will gain it back plus some. Slow is the best. Weight only once a week as that is the only time it is acurrate (water weight).
Then to keep it off, just do your weekly weight in and if it is up, cut back a little for the week.

whatever it was,  3 high readings on 3 separate occasions must be there before a diagnosis of hypertension is considered.

believe me, if your pulse is 54 at rest you are very healthy and you dont need any lifestyle modifications. my only advice would be to continue the same and stay away from smoking , alcohol, and drugs.

at such a young age the usual explanation for high blood pressure is secondary , meaning that there is an underlying disease. in that case lifestyle changes are not useful because the underlying condition must be treated.
lifestyle changes are useful for the hypertension that usually comes with middle age .

check out
(white coat hypertension)

its a false rise in blood pressure due to anxiety or fear, its the most common cause of misdiagnosis of hypertension.

ps
i dont know of a relation between bp and psoriasis.
like i said you should get 2 more measurements,and if it is still high, then you will have to think about possible underlying causes,like

kidney vascular abnormality
chronic kidney disease(pyelonephritis)
endocrine problems(pheochromocytoma,thyrotoxicosis)

You've certainly brought your medical concerns to the right place! The Y!A community members are fully aware of and do appreciate the intimate conditions involving your prognosis.
Most recognized doctors in the field of medicine would employ a holistic approach to your ailment. Lisa, please begin your day with a well balanced breakfast to include an ample portion of fruits and grains. After your morning routines are finished, enjoy a brisk walk around the block. If you happen to meet any stray dogs along the way, it would be a good idea to antagonize the creatures in order to add some vigor to your workout.
Now Lisa, the remaining portions of your day should be filled with interesting activities and new studies to keep your mind active and in balance, complimentary to what you have done with the physical side of yourself.
After loitering around at the public library all afternoon with a bunch of smelly hobos, you can appreciate a warm bath and time to be good to yourself. Begin to collect an archive of various music genres that you can resolve one day to enjoy after you get the rest of your chores done.
Lisa, if after following my advice, simply take two aspirin and forget we ever had this little discussion.

As my doctor sent me to a specialist to understand the cause of my gum recession, I was told (by the specialist) that the main problem is the bone loss.  In my case, the gum just follows the bone.

I am not sure I feel convinced as I have been flossing since I ever remember.  I never bleed when cleaning my teeth.   My mother has lost all her teeth very early in life and I am thinking this is more genetic than any thing else.

I would really appreciate any answer (link to any article, books ...)
How effective is deep cleaning for preventing oral bone loss?
How much your genes and caveties contribute to bone loss?

I am a male, 40s from Middle Eas decent.

Thanks.","I'm a registered dental hygienist. your ? is kind of conflicting (which i completely understand as you do not have   a degree in the dental field!!!) gum recession can be caused by agressive toothbrushing, a ""high muscle"" attachment (called a frenum), and yes bone loss. generally, patients who need a ""deep cleaning"" are overdue for their rountine cleaning, or don't have optimum oral hygiene (i.e. brushing, flossing, etc). and yes, genetics have A LOT to do w/ this. (cavities, however, are NOT related at all). if your chief concern is gum recession, a ""deep cleaning"" is not necessarily the answer. HOWEVER, it may have been your chief concern, but upon exam by the periodontist, you may need a deep cleaning to help w/ bone levels. did the periodontist ""measure"" your gums at all? or talk about any numbers? generally, a deep cleaning is needed when 4 teeth in each ""quadrant"" of your mouth (upper/lower, left/right) have at least one 4mm ""pocket"" or deeper. did the periodontist tell you that you have ""tarter"" or ""calculus"" buildup on your teeth? hope this makes sense.",Oral Bone Loss,35-44 years old,Male,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, I am having a problem accepting that plaques and caveties are the reason for my oral bone loss.

Anyway, for the past two or three years, I have been vomiting quite frequently. I can assure you, I am not bulemic. I vomit on average about every two weeks, but it can range from twice a day, to once every month and a half, but usually about every two weeks. When this happens, I usually will feel sick slightly on and off a few days prior. It most frequently occurs at night, but on occasion in the morning. I sometimes will wake up feeling sick, and throw up. I feel worst when I lie down. When I finish, I return to normal usually, and get dehydrated, and sometimes very hungry. After eating, it does not occur again usually. I have bad acid reflux, that I have had since I was a baby. I am on many medications for that. (I will also add that I have lately, since summer, but increased dramatically in October, have frequent diarrhea and cramps after eating). Any ideas what could be causing these symptoms?",Possibly the acid reflux or the many medications you are taking for it.  Anxiety can do that too.  Have you experienced anxiety a lot?

But, this sounds like your kidneys may be affected too.

As always, see your quack and if needed, you will get some anti-biotics.

In the meantime, drink cranberry juice.  It is a natural anti-biotic and superb for urinary tract/nladder infections.

Another symptom of infection is the feeling that you need regular pee visits and not much urine is there.

Burning pain is the most common symptom of a peptic ulcer. The pain is caused by the ulcer and is aggravated by stomach acid coming in contact with the ulcerated area. The pain typically may:

Be felt anywhere from your navel to your breastbone 
Last from a few minutes to many hours 
Be worse when your stomach is empty 
Flare at night 
Often be temporarily relieved by eating certain foods that buffer stomach acid or by taking an acid-reducing medication 
Come and go for a few days or weeks 
Less often, ulcers may cause severe signs or symptoms such as:

The vomiting of blood  which may appear red or black 
Dark blood in stools or stools that are black or tarry 
Nausea or vomiting 
Unexplained weight loss 
Chest pain

Any help would be appreciated!","This should have been arranged before your appointment. It is up to your doctor to order and schedule both tests. To show up and expect that the MRI technologist will just do both is very inconsiderate of the patients that will follow your appointment as a MRI usually takes  about 45 minutes and this will cause all the patients after you to be at least an hour late with their appointments.  If there is an open spot after your knee scheduled time, the tech can call your doctor and ask if it can be done, but this should have been brought up by you at your appointment with the ordering doctor. Many times, a reputable doctor will not order a test as expensive as an MRI without examining the patient.

OR, you can call the doctor before your appointment and have BOTH tests scheduled at once. You may have to switch days to do this, but it seems to be the best option.

Thanks in advance to everybody who replies.","Crud!! Welcome to the (rotten) club of Degenerative Disc Disease sufferers.  I don't have a herniated disc, but I have DDD and it is a drag.  There are some things I've learned from docs, some from painful experience, here they are; front to back motion is ok, it's the side to side that will get you.  Lifting is not good, but, remember, DDD is tricky and what you do today will probably not show up for 3 days, so you really have to pay attention to what you're doing and see how you feel 3 days from now (this is really hard to do).  DDD gets worse with time, so what you do this year that doesn't bother you may bother you next year.  The best way to keep your back in shape is; you have to exercise both your back AND your stomach muscles.  You need to have both the back and the front of your torso in good shape.  This gives you a ""band"" of strength in the area you need it most.  Good luck.",mild herniated disc,,Female,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,Yes: I was wondering can i continue all my activities with her.

88,528598,Any alternative to Metronidazole?,"Is there any alternative to Metronidazole? I have problems with some penicillin's and have been prescribed this for an abscess in my gum. I have had Metronidazole before, and felt dreadful- dizzy, couldn't get up, sick, numbness, which may or may not have been migraine triggered by this. I have started the course, but a day and a half into it, I am getting the same symptoms as before. I suspect the Metronidazole, but dentist says to put up with it. It is very difficult to do that. Any suggestions?
Greig","Yes an alternative is clindamycin and in serious cases, one of the newer fluoroquinolone antibiotics. For example, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin etc.. You'll need a prescription for any of these, so get off to a doctor or dentist a.s.a.p. before it gets worse. If you're sensitive to the penicilin family of antibioics you are probably also sensitive to the cephalosporin group too. Tell the doctor about your sensitivity. Incidentally metronidazole (Flagyl), and alcohol will give the mother of all hangovers. Absolutely, no alcohol consumption when you are on that very good antibiotic.

95,3608063,How do I get rid of the itching of Neurodermatitis?. Is this disease curable?,"I have a persistent itch on my face. The diagnosis from a lab-test is neurodermatitis. My research through Google tells me that it is not curable. How do I stop the itching? Is there anyone with this problem who can give me some help? I have suffered for the past 8 months and I am frustrated. Doctors prescribe lotions and the 5 different prescriptions do not help. Anyone who can provide me with information that might be helpful would have my sincerest gratitude. 

Thank you.","Moisturizers- Moisturizers or emollients including bath oils, soap substitutes can be applied to the dermatitis as frequently as required to relieve itching, scaling and dryness. Emollients should also be used on the unaffected skin to reduce dryness. Emollient therapy helps to restore one of the skin's most important functions, which is to form a barrier to prevent bacteria and viruses getting into the body and therefore help to prevent a rash becoming infected. Emollients are safe and rarely cause an allergic reaction. Occasionally, products with lanolin may cause a reaction. Ideally, moisturizers should be applied three to four times a day. Apply in a gentle downward motion in the direction of hair growth to prevent accumulation of cream around the hair follicle (this can cause infection of the follicle).

Coal Tar- Coal tar has been used to treat the itching and inflammation caused by skin conditions for hundreds of years. The tar contains chemicals that soothe the skin. Crude coal tar is a byproduct of oil production. It makes the skin more sensitive to light. In its natural state it is a thick, brownish-black substance that is messy to apply to the skin. Refined coal tar preparations, many of which are available over the counter, may be more cosmetically acceptable. Coal tar has been used for many years to treat psoriasis and it has few side effects. However, it does not work for everyone. In addition to being messy to use, it has a strong odor and can stain skin and clothing. It can cause sun sensitivity, and may irritate acute dermatitis. Tar creams or bath emulsions can be helpful for mild inflammation of atopic dermatitis. The smell may be offensive to some people.

Corticosteroids / Topical steroids ï¿½ Topical steroid medications are one of the most common treatments for mild to moderate psoriasis. They reduce redness (inflammation) and itching and stop the rapid build-up of dead skin cells. They come in varying strengths, from weak to highly potent. They are available as creams, gels, lotions, ointments, or solutions. A steroid mousse is now available to treat scalp psoriasis. Topical steroids can become less effective if used repeatedly for a long time. This is called resistance. The best outcome may be achieved when topical steroids are combined with other medications applied to the skin. Steroids in the form of pills or injections are generally not used to treat psoriasis because they have too many serious side effects. Also, psoriasis can come back worse than ever when treatment stops. Long-term use of potent topical steroids on large areas of skin can produce side effects such as stretch marks, thinning and reddening of the skin, and the appearance of small blood vessels through the skin. These medications should not be put on the face or on areas of the body where the skin folds, such as the armpits, groin, and webs of the toes. Use of steroid ointments and creams requires good judgment and careful supervision. They come in various strengths from mild to super-potent. Ask the doctor about potency and side effects of prescribed corticosteroid medicines. Corticosteroid medicines are prescribed for atopic dermatitis to calm the inflamed skin. Avoid combination topical steroid/antifungal cream in the treatment of diaper rash.

Topical Immunomodulators- Topical immunomodulators (TIMs) are a new type of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug for the treatment of eczema. Mild burning sensations have been reported when applying TIMs. In general, however, TIMs have fewer side effects than corticosteroids. TIMs are topical drugs that modulate the immune response (alter the reactivity of cell-surface immunologic responsiveness). Studies have shown that this class of drugs will improve or completely clear eczema in more than 80 percent of treated patients, with a side-effect profile comparable with topical steroids.

97,2591948,11 weeks and Iron deficient?,"Ok, I am between 11 and 12 weeks pregnant, the doctors aren't 100% sure, and my due date is Oct. 15..  I just had a checkup and my doc says I am iron deficient.  I know what it means and all, but I would like to know some ways to get more iron in my diet without flat-out taking supplements.  If anyone has any recipes that are an easy way to get a decent amount of iron, I'd really appreciate them.  Or just reccomendations for foods to eat.  Thanks a bunch!","One simple way is to cook in cast iron pots.  If you cook acidic foods for a long time, you will get a *big* increase in the iron content of the food, in a form that your body can digest more easily than that in supplements.  I would suggest making some long-cooking tomato sauce.

In addition, liver is high in iron.  However, it is the organ that cleanses the blood of the animal, so it may be high in pollutants that aren't good for you at any time--especially when you're pregnant.  If you can get organic liver, I'd say go for it.

Other foods that have iron include green vegetables (broccoli and kale in particular; spinach and other green leafy vegetables also have iron, but in a very poorly-absorbed form), egg yolks, and whole grains (avoid all white flour and white rice).

Eating vitamin C foods together with your iron-rich foods also helps absorption.  Red pepper is the food with the single highest vitamin C level, but citrus fruits, broccoli, strawberries, and white potatoes are also good.",iron deficient,,Female,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,"Yes: but I would like to know some ways to get more iron in my diet without flat-out taking supplements.

102,1482978,"HPV, getting pregnant and chance of miscarrages?","I have HPV and have had two coloposcopies with another one scheduled for the 28th. I have also had the LEEP procedure done once. I know the HPV never goes away, but I was wondering if anyone who has had LEEP or other HPV/abnormal Pap/mild dysplasia treatments done who have had problems either conceiving or carrying a baby to term? Does it hinder conception or does it cause early miscarriages? Can it still be treated during pregnancy?","HPV is unlikely to affect your pregnancy or your baby's health. If you have genital warts, they may grow faster during pregnancy, possibly from the extra vaginal discharge that provides the virus with a moist growing environment, hormonal changes, or changes in your immune system. In most cases they won't pose any problems for you or your baby.

It's possible for you to pass the virus to your baby, but this doesn't happen very often. Even if your child does contract HPV, he's likely to overcome it on his own without any symptoms or problems. In the unlikely event that he gets the type of HPV that causes genital warts, he may develop warts on his vocal cords and other areas sometime in infancy or childhood. This condition, called recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, is very serious, but fortunately it's also rare. 

There's no drug that can get rid of the virus. If you have warts, your practitioner may decide not to treat them during your pregnancy, because they often get better on their own or even disappear altogether after you give birth.There are various treatments, however, that can be used to remove the warts safely during pregnancy.

If your practitioner decides removal is necessary, she may use a special acid solution, freeze them off with a liquid nitrogen solution, or remove them by laser, by electrocautery, or surgically. (Two prescription products that women apply themselves are used to treat genital warts, but they're generally not recommended during pregnancy. And don't ever try to treat genital warts with drugstore medications meant for common warts.)

If your Pap smear is abnormal, your practitioner may examine your cervix and vagina with a special microscope in a procedure called colposcopy. (A colposcopy is no more uncomfortable than a Pap, though it takes longer.) If she sees suspicious changes in your cells, she may take a biopsy of the tissue, which can cause some temporary discomfort and bleeding.

If there's no evidence of invasive cancer, your practitioner will most likely wait until after you give birth to further treat the abnormal cells, although depending on your situation, the colposcopy might need to be repeated during your pregnancy. Your practitioner will follow up with another colposcopy about six to eight weeks after you give birth to see if the problem persists. In many cases, the abnormal changes go away on their own after delivery, making further interventions unnecessary.",HPV and have had two coloposcopies,,Female,,,,,,Does it hinder conception or does it cause early miscarriages , LEEP procedure done once,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes: Does it hinder conception or does it cause early miscarriages?

Also, I get headaches when I'm in the sun...even when I just see sunlight for a few minutes.","You do however, have an inflammatory process which is involving the cranial nerves..You have just mentioned 2 of them and more than one classifies it as a Migraine Syndrome. But, I am sure you will recognize these symptoms also.....ringing in the ears, balance distress, sensitivity to light, facial tenderness around the eyes and on the cheeks.. can go on with more but, you will notice there is considerable tenderness at the base of the skull on one side.

Benign positional vertigo is a diagnosis of the symptom but not what is causing it..besides you have more problems than the vertigo. Would make a pretty complicated diagnosis if all the symptoms were included in that diagnosis, as is the vertigo.

126,3168531,does my 2 year old have diabetes?,"Hi my daughter is 2 1/2 years old, recently she has been drinking excessively and constantly waking up soaking wet several times in the night.
I am frequently changing her nappy when we are out and when we are at home i am emptying her potty every 10 minutes this has only recently occured and even during the height of the summer when she would be expected to drink more her fluid intake was the same as normal.
basically what im asking is does any one out there have diabetic children and do they think this is linked i read that blurred vision is another symptom and she has just got her first pair of glasses.
If some one could give me some advice before i take her to the doctors i would be very grateful.
thanks","There are two types of diabetes.  The first, Type I, used to be refered to as juvenile diabetes because it was detected in childhood.  It is caused when the cells in the Isle of Langerhans in the spleen quit producing insulin or die.  It requires injections of insulin to treat.
  The other, Type II, is usually associated with late adulthood.  The person still produces insulin, usually in normal amounts, but due to a metabolic/edocrine malfunction, the body is unable to use the insulin as efficiently as it should.  A variation of this type is known as Gestational Diabetes, and develops only during pregnancy and disappears with delivery.  It is an indicator of risk to develop Type II later in life, but not a guarentee.
  It is rare to diagnose Type II diabetes in a child so young, but not so rare to diagnose Type !.  Although she does seem to urinate and drink a great deal, that in itself can have plenty of other explainations.   Juvenile diabetes is not a condition that develops slowly, and there is most usually a crisis point when the sugar levels in the blood reach dangerous levels.  That leads to a hospital/ER visit, and the diagnosis.  Your daughter is not likely truly diabetic, although there is something going on that the pediatrician needs to check out.  There are too many other potential problems to consider with the limited amount of information that you could disclose on the web, and of course testing ability is nil.
  The vision difficulties could be related, or could be simply due to genetics.  The doctor, unfortunately is the only one who can do that sort of determination.  Small children represent a practice of medicine completely different from that of adults, or even older children.  The rules that apply to the rest of us simply don't apply to small ones as young as your daughter.
  The doctor should be able to eliminate your diabetes concerns quite easily with a blood sugar test, and possibly a glucose tolerance test.  That is a bit difficult to do with one so small, as the glucose solution invariably makes them ill.  But that would be the logical first step.  I imagine the first test he will do is the simple blood sugar test, and a urine test to detect sugar in the urine.   From there it is hard to say what he/she will look into, as that would depend on his exam and her medical history- and the family history as well.
  I really don't think you have to be concerned about the juvenile diabetes.  While it is not unknown in one so young, that is usually associated with a very strong family history of the disorder.  It is also associated with viral infections, usually a very severe infection accompanied by high fever.   Most juvenile diabetics are closer to 9 or 10 at onset.  It also doesn't tend to develop over months, but rather days.
  As one mother to another, I wish I could tell you there was nothing to be concerned about, but truthfully I can't even completely eliminate the possibility that you are correct.  I can tell you that the likelyhood is low, and that the problems you are having are from some other cause.  Hopefully it will be something simple and easily treated, or even something she will outgrow.  The vision problems could certainly be simply little growing eyes, and also correct themselves with age.   In the meantime, gather as much of your family medical history as you can.  Find out what sort of medical problems there have been, and look at what ages any of them first needed glasses.  If you or several members of your family needed glasses as children, that could be your answer for that.  I wish you good news from the doctor, and hope your little girl has a simple to fix ailment.",drinking excessively and constantly waking up soaking wet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, basically what im asking is does any one out there have diabetic children and do they think this is linked i read that blurred vision is another symptom and she has just got her first pair of glasses.~~~,diabetic,,,,,,,"Yes: If some one could give me some advice before i take her to the doctors i would be very grateful.

I have very low blood pressure, anaemia  and before anyone says eat this and eat that, I have always had low blood pressure, anaemia and constantly (seasonal), have sinus attacks.. So much so I had to have x2 operations to clear the right and the left sinus passages.  etc, etc.

I have always had to take iron tablets, which combat the dizzy and tired feelings.  The minute I do not take the tablets, and monthly vitamin B injections, I start the dizzy / tired feelings again.  

By the way, are you a small lady.  I am 41kg and 5ft3"".  Small lady's are most likely to suffer from low blood pressure.  You must also take an extremely good vitamin tablet and caltrate plus for your bones etc.  DAILY.

and,  having sinusitus (chronic) leaves you feeling ""drunk"", lightheaded, because of all the congestion.  Big worry is when your nose (the gooeeeeeyyyy stuff inside) cannot be ""blown"" out.
You need to get homeopathic drops to be taken daily, called Sambuccus Comp. Drops ""Weleda"".  I don""t know if you can get this where you are.  I use it daily.   It definately relieves your sinus, and relieves the dizzy, vertigo feeling.  If it does not you must be referred to an ear, nose and throat specialist by your doctor.

145,3566905,What should I do? I'm perfectly healthy all this time then all of a sudden...?,"I went to the doctor to see if there was something I could do about the fact that I bruise easy. I've always bruised easy, since I can remember, I'm just more concerned now that I'm older and people think that I'm abused. So I go to the doc and they do all kinds of blood work and then the doc said the nurse was concerned about my heart rate (46) so they did an EKG and sent me on my way and said they would send the results to me in a week or two. Yesterday I got a message on my answering machine, the doctor  had scheduled a echo cardio gram (heart ultrasound) for friday. The doc didn't even call me to tell me anything. I've been trying to call the doctors office all day and the receptionist keeps giving me the nurses voice mail. I never had any problems before. Why wouldn't they call before scheduling something like that or atleast tell me why. My Dad said not to go for the test until they tell me why they want to give it in the first place.","My personal opinion is I would go for the test and ask them then.  I would also continue to call.  Did you leave a message with the nurse?  I think if the doctor scheduled for this test it must be important and it would be silly to no go because he didn't call you personally.  If you don't like the way they are handling your case after the test, take the test results to another doctor and get a second opinion.  I hope it all turns out alright.  Good Luck!

Sometimes doctors forget there a faces beyond the tests they are looking at and don't always have the best bedside manner.  Unfortunately some of the best doctors out there seem to have the worst bed side manners. When you call express your concerns to the nurse they will usually listen to you and help you get the information you need.

149,1921805,Borderline Personality Disorder Question?,"I suspect my partner has borderline personality disorder. He's finally agreed to see a professional about it so I want to make sure it's the right person.
Should he see a psychiatrist, psychologist or a counsellor? In my understanding, a psychiatrist can diagnose, use therapy and prescribe medication, whilst a psychologist can't prescribe medication.
The literature I've read about BPD indicates that medication is not always beneficial, that various forms of long term therapy in which the BP's relearn coping mechanisms and appropriate emotional responses is more appropriate.
Therefore, would a psychologist be sufficient? Money is an issue as he has recently lost his job again and I understand a psychiatrist is very expensive.
I have read other peoples questions and answers related to this. There seems to be a popular idea that we all have problems at times and that these people are often misdiagnosed. I am studying psychology(I've only just started) and I know this is real.
Advice?","This is a great question (or series of questions); and I think it's great that you are getting involved in improving your partners well being.  I've been diagnosed Bipolar/BPD and am under intensive psychotherapy and med management therapy as well.

BPD is a very complex and serious mental illness characterized by pervasive instability in mood, interpersonal relationships, self-image, identity, and behavior. This instability often disrupts family and work life, long-term planning, and the individual's sense of self.

I think you're on to something and reaching out at these boards is great.  However, we are all pop psychiatrists and none of us can diagnose your partner, so it's imperative that you pony up and have him see the doc ASAP and get a diagnosis so you can begin proper treatment. 

I understand the issue of funds, which was a similar issue I faced at the outset of my treatment.  It's often difficult for some poeple to rationalize the importance of mental health vs. physical health.  For example, if you found out your partner needed a certain surgical procedure, per the Dr's recommendation, where if delayed, came with fatal results, would you factor in the financial roadblocks?

As far as medication vs. non-medication approach.  Med Management should be at the forefront of the treatment for BPD where psychotherapy will exist as an adjunct treatment.  What's important to understand is that BPD is often co-morbid, where it will exist with another disorder; e.g. bipolar, ADD, unipolar depression, etc.  Understanding the patient is struggling in dealing with unstable moods, thoughts and emotions, your Dr. will be able to prescribe meds to bring your partner to a more stable mindset so they can go to the next phase of treatment an begin psychotherapy.  Specifically, mood stabilizers are extremely effective and will do wonders for your partner, relatively quickly.  

Through my experience, I tend to feel like I'm fighting in a war, battling in the trenches, where depression is my enemy, medication is my armour and weaponry and my psychologists are my commanding officers, providing strategy and tactics in guiding me through the field of battle.  All of those tools combined will help defeat the enemy and guide you to safety.

I've tried meds without therapy and vice versa;  I couldn't do it.  It's very difficult at first to put yourself through Psychotherapy, but over time, you'll find that it will build strength and a better sense of self if you put in the effort.

As for the meds, I saw a psychiatrist regularly at first after going through a combination of different meds/doses.  Over time, I've found the right med/dose and acheived stabliization in my moods,thoughts and actions, which has done wonders in my life both personally and professionally.

As for the psycotherapy; I attend regular CBT (cognitive behavior therapy) weekly and group therapy twice a week and attend other support groups as needed.  The combination of which have helped initiate motivation and change in combating my illness.  When someone lives with such an illness for a long period of time, they develop learned behaviors which are incredibly difficult to change.  The psychotherapy will give you the motivation to make yourself better and the ability to change certain problematic behaviors; which is a monumental task in itself, but it is certainly acheivable.

Beyond the possible anti-cancer properties of the above, it looks like the ginger can help with nausea from the chemo and inflamation and the maitaki mushroom can help with immune system and chemo side effects.","Check out ""How to Prevent and Treat Cancer with Natural Medicine"" by Michael Murray ND, and ""Beating Cancer With Nutrition"" by Patrick Quillen.

I was told to avoid Albuterol because with beta-blockers it could cause bronchial spasms and worse.

168,620863,Does anyone know anything about LCPD or Legg Calve  Perthes Disease?,"We were told my 3 year old grandson has it almost a year ago and that his bone to his hip is completely dead and all we could do was watch him and do x-rays to watch for changes. 2 weeks ago after the x-rays he told us to cut his activities back and give him Motrin 2 to 3 times a day. No jumping, climbing,kicking, sliding or any kind of playground activities.This will be for years. He said this is the beginning of the critical time for him. I know this disease is rare and I just wonder if there are many people out there with kids this young and how do you deal with with slowing them down. We have adopted him and he is a little 100% boy always climbing and running and it is so hard to get him to slow down. He does not understand that it will hurt him. If anyone knows anything about this disease I would like to hear from you. Thank  You..","Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease (aseptic or avascular necrosis of the femoral head)

Avascular necrosis occurs when the bone that makes up the ball portion of the hip is damaged from lack of blood supply. The reasons this occurs are not clear. Since a higher incidence of this disorder is noted in several dog breeds, including terrier breeds, miniature pinscher, poodles and possibly schipperkes, it is assumed that there may be a genetic component to the problem. In Manchester terriers, the genetic component appears to be a strong influence and heritability is pretty high for this problem.

Most of the time the clinical signs of this disease occur in 4 to 11 month old dogs and usually consist of lameness of one leg only. Pain may be mild to very severe. Some dogs have mild forms of this condition and do not require medical care. In other dogs, the condition cause sufficient pain and deformity of the hip joint to require surgical intervention. The disorder can usually be confirmed with X-rays. Atrophy of the muscles of the affected leg is not uncommon. If this is severe it can slow the recovery period considerably and may make medical therapy less likely to work.

Treatment of this condition varies according to the severity of the signs seen. In mild cases, enforced rest may be sufficient to allow healing of the damaged areas to occur. In some cases, immobilization of the affected limb using an Ehmer sling may be beneficial to recovery. Many dogs have advanced cases of this disease by the time they are examined by a veterinarian and medical treatment is not likely to work. In these dogs, excision of the femoral head (ball portion of the hip joint) is often beneficial. Removal of this section of the bone diminishes painful bony contact in the hip joint. Recovery from this surgery can be slow with recovery periods of up to one year sometimes occurring before good use of the affected leg returns. If muscle atrophy is not present at the time of surgery the recovery time is usually much less. Pain relief and anti-inflammatory medications may be beneficial.

There is a stronger tendency to treat this as a medical condition prior to surgery right now. A general rule of thumb is to allow non-surgical therapy a month to show a beneficial response. If one is not seen, surgical repair should be considered more carefully.",LCPD or Legg Calve  Perthes Disease,,,,,,,,He said this is the beginning of the critical time for him.,LCPD or Legg Calve  Perthes Disease,,,,,,,,,,,I just wonder if there are many people out there with kids this young and how do you deal with with slowing them down.

10,3897103,Do diseases vary among race?,I've heard that Lupus is primarily a disease among asians and native Americans. My grandmother is half Cherokee Indian. My mother died 3 years ago from the complications of lupus and the drugs she was taking. I've also heard that African Americans are more likely to get menningitis than others. Sickle cell anemia seems to be another disease among blacks. Is this accurate? And if it is: what genetic factors are involved with this?,"The frequency of diseases do vary by race to some degree. The most common reason is genetic or cultural or unknown.  For instance diabetes is very common in the Indian populations in Upstate New York because of the many years of inbreeding in the small population. Glucose levels can be on the average twice as high than the normal white population.  There are cultural traditions in some sub-populations that cause diseases - one which was common on Islands in the pacific was some thing called Laughing Disease - It was caused by eating the brain of the tribal member you just killed.  The brain carried a virus that infected the brain of the guy who is eating the brain.  Ugh

A recently medical study out of John Hopkins which compared more than 15,000 patients comparing disease out comes found that there were still poorer results for certain races when compared to the average population and they could not uncover the cause because all  of the studied population receive identical treatment. They assumed that there was some cause for the statical variation but they made no clinical conclusion other than it was unknown at this time.  

Lupus is found in all populations to some degree and I have never heard that it is more common in Asians and native Americans. As far as meningitis in Africans - I have not found any study that confirms it is more common.  You are correct that sickle cell anemia is much more common in blacks than other populations and that is a genetic issue. 

If you are Eastern European or Italian and have the gene called HLA- B27 - you will have the potential for more intestinal diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, diverticulitis, and other diseases related to that gene. Having gene does not mean you will get the diseases it means you will have a great probability to come down with these diseases.",Do diseases vary among race,,,,My mother died 3 years ago from the complications of lupus and the drugs she was taking.,mother died,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Do diseases vary among race?,,,,,,Not applicable,,,

Anyway, upon a blood tests they found massive Grave's, gave me the meds, and all went well.  I went into remission about 1 year after the diagnosis at age 23.  I grew an inch taller and developed breasts (what a wonderful concept) that year as well.  I finally developed fat cells, long awaited, at age 25 and looked a healthy weight from then onward.

Yes, you can have children, but please wait until you are in remission from the Grave's.  You really don't want to be playing with Grave's when you are pregnany, since that's an additional factor which must be considered.

My advice is be patient with the whole process.  They have to first determine the best treatments ... I say treatments because for me it was PTU, which turned out not to work, to tapazol, which did work.  Had that not worked, we would have got to the subpartial thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine procedure.  You'll have monthly blood tests, enough to know your phlebotomist by name each time.  

No, it's not common to develop Grave's at your age.  I'd never met anyone (until I just talked to you) who had developed it like me.  BUT ... I have to tell you, be very thankful it has been found!  I went through 7 years of thinking I was going crazy, stupid doctor-prescribed weight gain diets, being forbidden from any exercise whatsoever (I'd lose too much weight), and unexplained emergency room visits for malnutrition (and I ate like a horse).  So, knowing what it is is half the battle.  Now you just have to figure out how you'll manage the next year being patient.  You will get better ... you're not ""cured"" but you can go into remission.  

I went into remission at age 23, had monthly blood tests for a while (still in remission), then graduated to six months (still in remission) then went to yearly (still in remission).  About 8 years later, my doctor didn't want to do the blood test, since he said I was fine.  I insisted, since I have an abiding fear of Grave's, and it's a good thing I did. I now have Hashimoto's, the exact opposite of Grave's.  I am hypo and take replacement thyroid hormone.

According to the research I did on Grave's, the docs aren't sure where the Grave's antibody comes from, but it looks like thyroid disorders can run in families, which was my case (I have 4 maternal aunts and my mother with thyroid issues).  Further, there is some indication that the thyroid comes with a shelf life, which is what I think is occuring with me.  With the way it went unchecked for so long (I was almost in thyroid storm, my numbers were so high -- the doc didn't know how I was alive), my thyroid really went into overdrive.  What if it can operate that way for only so long?  Anyway, that's the premise I operate on today, that the Grave's is gone forever and Hashimoto's is here to stay. My endocrinologist told me not to make such absolute statements, but I think the thyroid I have is dying slowly ... I'd much rather this than Grave's since Grave's is so insidious with me.

Anyhow, I am now 38 and that's my story.  I hope it makes you feel a bit better that it can happen to teens.  You also need to be vigilant from now on, telling docs you need that blood test just to be safe, etc.  You WILL go into remission, one way or the other, and there are no real bad effects later on from this, as long as you keep on top of it.

It should take about a week. If the doc has not called you back, you call him. I know from experience that waiting is pure torture! The mind can go to all kinds of weird places. 

Hang in there and be sure when you re-visit your doc that you bring your questions written down. I would also suggest that you bring another person with you when you get your results (assuming you get them in the office).

69,1065636,Has anyone ever been diagnosed with Compartment Syndrome?,"I am a runner who has been diagnosed with bilateral compartment syndrome in my lower legs.  I am currently seeing a specialist, as well as recieving therapy a few times a week.  The thing is, I am finding that the stretching and exercises that I have been shown to do feel like they are worsening my injury rather then improving it. Has anyone else ever worked through this injury, and if so, do you have any tips on how to decrease the pain associated with working out/ training/ living!?","did your doctors explain to you what the pain was being caused by? It is generally due to an increase in pressure within the compartment of muscles on the anterior aspect of the lower leg. There is not a lot of give in the sheaths holding the muscles together so an exercise level you are not used to, or even a new exercise may cause swelling in the anterior muscles, increasing the pressure.

In some extreme cases, surgery is required to remove the pressure as blood vessels and nerves to the area can become damaged, a side effect of which is necrotic tissue (tissue that has died due to a lack of oxygen). Your doctors should have already addressed this with you, but if not and your pain continues, bring it up with them. As if the inflammation continues, you could get septicemia which is deadly.

You could try an ice pack after doing your stretches to decrease the swelling, or elevating your legs above heart level. I would also talk to your specialist and tell them of your concerns. It may be they might have to manipulate the stretches for you, or the stretches may not be right for the current stage in recovery you are in.

During the day, anti-inflammatory drugs may also help. Check before taking these though if you are a competitive athlete as some may be on the banned list!

Keep in mind, this may all be a normal part of the healing process as you are working already inflamed muscles.!.

Every 2 hours, I gargled with warm salt water, drank a full glass of lukewarm water (didn't want to upset my stomach), and did a ""steam treatment"" on my sinuses. Basically, I got a kitchen towel, soaked it in hot, steamy water, and without wringing it out, placed it over my mouth and nose and breathed in the warm steam. I also placed Vicks vapor rub over my chest and throat and slept with a warm heating pad over my chest while I got lots of rest!!!! I also added Mucinex which worked wonderfully.

An arachnoid cyst is a cyst of the middle membrane that surrounds the brain, which is called the arachnoid. It is one of three membranes of this type. The only treatment, as you probably already know, is surgery to remove it. Anything that grows inside your head that's not supposed to be there can cause increases in the pressure inside the brain, which is absolutely detrimental, so even if it's benign--which an arachnoid cyst IS--they want to remove it ASAP.

what were the warning signs that you experienced when you were diognosed with diabetes? and how old were u? what is your life like now? 

i am just scared, i dont want to have this disease....","Hello,

First off I am not a Doctor. But I have had diabetes for over 34 years and have studied diabetes for years.

With your family history it is very possible that you too could have diabetes. The disease is heredity. There are several different types of diabetis and by what you explained in your question it sounds like you might have HYPOGLYCEMIA. This is caused by your pancreous producing too much of the hormone INSULIN. What this means is that your body is producing too much insulin and causes your sugar level to drop. This causes the symptoms you explained. In fact, I have the very same symptoms when my blood sugar is low. Without a decent sugar level (70-120) your body does not have the energy you need to move. This is usually controlled by diet, exercise, and testing your blood sugar. A glucose test will tell the Dr. if your body is producing enough insulin to handle large amounts of sugar. If your body is not handling the sugar will your results will show high blood sugar. The thyroid can also play a part in diagnosing diabetis.

Symptoms of uncontrolled diabetis include headaches, extreme tiredness, vomiting, stomach pain, excessive urination and burning when you urinate, sores that won't heal, and extreme thirst and without treatment could lead to you passing out and coma.

I was about 11 when I was diagnosed and I'm 45 now. I have lived a good life and not much stands in my way. I pretty determined. I have my ups and downs and I do have a few complications like neuropthy. I've had two children and both of them are fine. The only difference is I have to pay attention to my disease, test my sugar, eat right. Nothing more than what an extreme health nut would do to stay healthy.

Good luck and let me know if you have any questions.

These symptoms arent consisently there, maybe 1-2 times a day for an hour or so. Can a high blood pressure medication cause such or is this some unrelated condition that I should seek out?","Possible Side Effects of Drugs That Lower Blood Pressure
Some of the drugs listed below can affect certain functions of the body, resulting in bad side effects. However, drugs that lower blood pressure have proven effective over the years. The benefits of using them far outweigh the risk of side effects. Most people whoï¿½ve taken these drugs havenï¿½t had any problems.

Diuretics ï¿½ Some of these drugs may decrease your body's supply of a mineral called potassium. Symptoms such as weakness, leg cramps or being tired may result. Eating foods containing potassium may help prevent significant potassium loss. You can prevent potassium loss by taking a liquid or tablet that has potassium along with the diuretic, if your doctor recommends it. Diuretics such as amiloride (Midamar), spironolactone (Aldactone) or triamterene (Dyrenium) are called ""potassium sparing"" agents. They donï¿½t cause the body to lose potassium. They might be prescribed alone but are usually used with another diuretic. Some of these combinations are Aldactazide, Dyazide, Maxzide or Moduretic.

Some people suffer from attacks of gout after prolonged treatment with diuretics. This side effect isn't common and can be managed by other treatment.

In people with diabetes, diuretic drugs may increase the blood sugar level. A change in drug, diet, insulin or oral antidiabetic dosage corrects this in most cases. Your doctor can change your treatment. Most of the time the degree of increase in blood sugar isn't much. Impotence may also occur in a small percentage of people.

Beta-blockers ï¿½ Acebutolol (Sectral), atenolol (Tenormin), metoprolol (Lopressor), nadolol (Corgard), pindolol (Visken), propranolol (Inderal) or timolol (Blocadren) may cause insomnia, cold hands and feet, tiredness or depression, a slow heartbeat or symptoms of asthma. Impotence may occur. If you have diabetes and youï¿½re taking insulin, have your responses to therapy monitored closely.

ACE inhibitors ï¿½ These drugs, such as captopril (Capoten), enalapril (Vasotec), lisinopril (Zestril or Prinivil), may cause a skin rash; loss of taste; a chronic dry, hacking cough; and in rare instances, kidney damage.

Angiotensin II receptor blockers ï¿½ These drugs may cause occasional dizziness.

Calcium channel blockers ï¿½ Diltiazem (Cardizem), nicardipine (Cardene), Nifedipine (Procardia) and verapamil (Calan or Isoptin) may cause palpitations, swollen ankles, constipation, headache or dizziness. Side effects with each of these drugs differ a great deal.

Alpha blockers ï¿½ These drugs may cause fast heart rate, dizziness or a drop in blood pressure when you stand up.

Combined alpha and beta blockers ï¿½ People taking these drugs may experience a drop in blood pressure when they stand up.

Central agonists ï¿½ Alpha methyldopa (Aldomet) may produce a greater drop in blood pressure when you're in an upright position (standing or walking) and may make you feel weak or faint if the pressure has been lowered too far. This drug may also cause drowsiness or sluggishness, dryness of the mouth, fever or anemia. Male patients may experience impotence. If this side effect persists, your doctor may have to change the drug dosage or use another medication.

Clonidine (Catapres), guanabenz (Wytensin) or guanfacine (Tenex) may produce severe dryness of the mouth, constipation or drowsiness. If you're taking any of these drugs, donï¿½t stop suddenly, because your blood pressure may rise quickly to dangerously high levels.

Peripheral adrenergic inhibitors ï¿½ Reserpine may cause a stuffy nose, diarrhea or heartburn. These effects aren't severe and no treatment is required other than to change the amount of drugs taken. If you have nightmares or insomnia or get depressed, tell your doctor. You should stop using the drugs.

Guanadrel (Hylorel) or guanethidine (Ismelin) may cause some diarrhea, which may persist in some people.

Any help please",Sed Rate range differ depending on gender and age.  The best thing for you to do is talk to your doctor about your concerns. Wounds with mrsa that have closed are difficult to detect if the mrsa is gone.  I work in a facility and deal with mrsa from time to time. There are different types of mrsa. from the lungs to the urine. I asked one of our doctors about mrsa in the wound and how someone can tell if the mrsa is gone and she told me that there is no 100% way of knowing. Usually when the wound closes and the patient has been treated properly with antibiotic (usually vancomycin) it is considered to be treated. If the wound heals with no signs and symptoms of infection (no swelling or redness) then there is no infection.  She also told me that everyone has a small amount of mrsa in the body. It is the level of mrsa that the person needs treated.  If his red blood cell count is low and iron is down it might be good to have him on an iron deficiency otc med. He might be anemic.  The best advice I can give you is ask your family physician and also your surgical doctor of your concerns. This is also why they get paid.  I hope I helped you in some way.,infection,,Female,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I am just not sure what will determine when or if the infection is gone.,infection,,,,,What is the therapeutic range everyone is talking about.,,,,,,Not applicable,,,

Not all tumors are fast growers. It could be benign one, but only a doctor can tell u.  Since your lossing weight, it wouldn't hurt to be ck out by physcian to ensure it's fat ur burning and not a loss of muscle.

At 5'3"", this is considered morbidly obese, and now that I am finally committed to doing something about it in an effort to improve my overall health, my doctor has prescribed this diet, which also limits salt and sugar, due to diabetes and high blood pressure running in my family.  I am unable to do much exercise due to my range of mobility being limited from the complications of my illness, so my questions are as follows...  a)Is this diet safe?

I spoke with the 5 Dr.'s I work with and my family doctor before I started it, and they all said that it is safe, but to take multi-vit.'s because it is very hard to get all your food groups in your meals.  Exercise can be anything from just sitting in a chair and making circles with your legs and arms, to walking.  You can start out slow, that's no problem.  Don't overdo it, but do as much as you possibly can.  When you start to lose weight, you'll see how easy it is to get up and move around, therefore you can do more exercises.  Drink at least 8 8oz. glasses of water everyday, and fill up with fiber.  It helps you feel fuller longer.  This diet DOES get easier as you get on it, because your lifestyle changes, and you just get used to it.  Trust me, you can do it!  I wish you the best of luck with this.  After the first month, it will get easier and easier.  One thing with low-cal diets is that it lowers your metabolism, but the exercise actually keeps it up, so you kind of even it out.

It doesnï¿½t burn or anything. I use this little thing and stick it in my hole just to prevent it. I am not bleeding or anything. So what can I do to prevent it from happening again? BTW I am only 19.","Some of the symptoms of hemmorrhoids are: 

bright red blood covering the stool, 
painful swelling around the anus, 
hard lump around the anus, 
fissures, 
fistulae, 
abscesses, 
irritation and itching (pruritus ani). 

Excessive straining, rubbing or cleaning the anus may worsen symptoms.

Hemorrhoids are caused by too much pressure in the rectum, forcing blood to stretch and bulge the walls of the veins. Sometimes the pressure ruptures the veins.

Medical treatment of hemorrhoids initially is aimed at relieving symptoms. Symptoms can be reduced by: sitting in a a warm tub, Ice packs (to help reduce swelling), usage of a hemorrhoidal cream. Increasing fiber and fluids in the diet will also help (makes softer stool).

In some cases, hemorrhoids must be treated surgically. The doctor will shrink and destroy the hemorrhoidal tissue. 

Adding fiber to your diet

If you suddenly add large amounts of fiber to your diet, you may experience bloating, diarrhea, and severe stomach cramping. It is best to add fiber to your diet gradually, eating small amounts of fiber rich foods.

138,4270551,Can You Get Periodontal Disease From Kissing Someone Else?,"I have several questions regarding Periodontal Disease. I read in a magazine that if your toothbrush touches someone else's and they have periodontal disease, chances are you will get it to. 
So my first question is can you get periodontal disease by kissing someone who has the disease?
Second question is, is it contagious? 
Third question, What can you do to prevent Periodontal Disease?
And last question, once you have Periodontal Disease, do you always have it??

Any info you may have, would be greatly appreciated.
And for the wise a&& who suggests that I brush my teeth, thanks but I already do that!!","Sorry, but you are mistaken.  You cannot ""catch"" periodontal disease (gum disease) from anyone or someone's toothbrush.  It is NOT contagious.  It is caused by the growth of bacteria on the teeth and gums. Bacteria are present in plaque, a clear, sticky substance your mouth produces. If plaque is not removed promptly, it builds up on the teeth.

Prevention is simple:
Brush your teeth in the morning, after meals and snacks, and before bed using fluoride toothpaste. 
Try an electric toothbrush that has a rotating and oscillating (back-and-forth) action. This type of toothbrush is better at removing plaque.
Use an antiseptic mouthwash, such as Listerine, or a fluoride or antiplaque mouthwash. 
Floss once a day.  
Use disclosing tablets periodically so you can see if you are brushing effectively. 
See your dentist regularly to have your teeth cleaned and checked. 

No, you won't always have it as it is treatable..especially in the early phases.

Also to mention they are more sore on the sides...that never happens.  Has anyone ever had this happen to them and ended up preggo?,"Check to see if these relate and then go to your doctor.

Tender, swollen breasts
One of the early signs of pregnancy is sensitive, sore breasts caused by increasing levels of hormones. The soreness may feel like an exaggerated version of how your breasts feel before your period. Your discomfort should diminish significantly after the first trimester, as your body adjusts to the hormonal changes. 

Fatigue
Feeling tired all of a sudden? No, make that exhausted. No one knows for sure what causes early pregnancy fatigue, but it's possible that rapidly increasing levels of the hormone progesterone are contributing to your sleepiness.

You should start to feel more energetic once you hit your second trimester, although fatigue usually returns late in pregnancy when you're carrying around a lot more weight and some of the common discomforts of pregnancy make it more difficult to get a good night's sleep

Nausea or vomiting
If you're like most women, morning sickness won't hit until about a month after conception. (A lucky few escape it altogether.) But some women do start to feel queasy a bit earlier. And not just in the morning, either ï¿½ pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting can be a problem morning, noon, or night.

About half of women with nausea feel complete relief by the beginning of the second trimester. For most others it takes another month or so for the queasiness to ease up. 

Increased sensitivity to odors
If you're newly pregnant, it's not uncommon to feel repelled by the smell of a bologna sandwich or cup of coffee and for certain aromas to trigger your gag reflex. Though no one knows for sure, this may be a side effect of rapidly increasing amounts of estrogen in your system. You may also find that certain foods you used to enjoy are suddenly completely repulsive to you. 

Abdominal bloating
Hormonal changes in early pregnancy may leave you feeling bloated, similar to the feeling some women have just before their period arrives. That's why your clothes may feel snugger than usual at the waistline, even early on when your uterus is still quite small. 

Frequent urination
Shortly after you become pregnant, you may find yourself hurrying to the bathroom all the time. Why? Mostly because during pregnancy the amount of blood and other fluids in your body increases, which leads to extra fluid being processed by your kidneys and ending up in your bladder.

This symptom may start as early as six weeks into your first trimester and continue or worsen as your pregnancy progresses and your growing baby exerts more pressure on your bladder. 

A missed period
If you're usually pretty regular and your period doesn't arrive on time, you'll probably take a pregnancy test long before you notice any of the above symptoms. But if you're not regular or you're not keeping track of your cycle, nausea and breast tenderness and extra trips to the bathroom may signal pregnancy before you realize you didn't get your period. 

Your basal body temperature stays high
If you've been charting your basal body temperature and you see that your temperature has stayed elevated for 18 days in a row, you're probably pregnant

10,1030497,Help Doctors! My leg goes numb when I run..........?,"I am in the Army and 2 years ago I had a leg injury for overpushing myself in training. I couldnt run for about 6 months cause it still hurt. Then after a while I could run again but instead of pain, my right lower leg would go numb sometimes to the point where I feel like I am dragging my foot cause its numb and I have to stop running.  I was diagnosed with compartment syndom in my lower leg and I had a fasciotomy in January.  But when I started running again, my leg still goes numb but now its goes up to the back of my thigh.  Its not pain, its just a numb feeling which is annoying and makes me have to stop running even if its only after 1 mile.  I think they mighthave made the incision in the wrong place (front side of my calf), since now it is becoming more obvious that the numbness is in the back of my leg. Could the surgeon have cut on the wrong compartment, or could it be something else other than compartment syndrome (even though all the sympthoms are the same)? Please help!!","You do know the US Army takes doctors who have lost their license due to malpractice...saw it on 60 minutes.

My guess is the numbness is caused by pressure (impingement) on a nerve.

If you're still active duty, avoid the blame game on your doctor...they'll all be afraid to help you.

Start with sick call and complain about the numness.
You'll get a profile and a weeks supply of Ibuprofen.
After the profile expires, complain again...you may get lucky with an x-ray referal.
The x-rays will turn out non-conclusive and you'll get another profile and more Ibuprofen.
At that point you can ask for an MRI...if they deny you; ask to see a civilian doctor.

If you can't get a referal for a civilian doctor...go to a civilian med station at the mall on a Sunday. Tell the civilian doc every last detail. Hopefully, you'll get that MRI and they can see what went wrong or what is wrong.

The Sciatic nerve guess is a good one...but the numbness from an impinged sciatic nerve will continue up your foot and into your leg.

Your story is so common there is a syndrome named after it- failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS).  Unfortunately you are probably going to have these problems to some degree or another for the rest of your life.  Far too often people jump right into drugs and surgery and fail to explore the other options that are far less invasive and, frankly more effective (70% of back surgeries fail).  There are literally hundreds of options and you have already mentioned one, decompression.  If you had a spinal fusion, which it sounds like you did, it's too late for that.  They bridged the spinal joints with bone and now there is to joint to decompress.  The best option you have now is chiropractic (it was your best option five years ago too, but it's a little late for that now).  If you had L4-S1 fused, the problem you are facing now is that L3 is having to do a ton of work... a lot more work than it was designed to do.  Chiropractic can help to make sure that L3 stays healthy and isn't the next to go.  Your Doctor (chiropractic not medical) should also ensure that your pelvis is free of distortion.  This will help.

Back then, cold sores weren't acknowledged as related to herpes, and no one knew how quickly they could cause genital herpes, so people weren't precautious about the virus at all.

I want to be precautious about this, so here's my questions:

1)  How contagious is the virus after the sore heals up?

2)  Could my husband already have contracted it from me sexually, even when I had no open sore?

3)  After the sore heals, how long should I wait before going back to sexual activities?

4)  Is it dead-set that my children will have this virus?

5)  How contagious am I to others on the street, people at work, etc?","You were so misinformed

*HSV-1 is not hereditary

*You can only spread it by kissing, or drinking from the same glass if you have an open sore.

*Once the sore is dried up and clear, you are no longer contagious. 

*Your children will only get it if you kiss them or drink after them from the same glass, when you have an open sore.

*You are not contagious to people on the street.

*You can pass HSV-1 to the genital area by performing oral sex if you have an open sore, so wait until it is dried and cleared away.

*You don't think you can get Pink eye from HSV-1, but you can with gonorrhea, chlamydia, and other bacterial infections.

*The one and only thing you can do with a flair up is WASH YOUR HANDS after you touched the infected area to prevent spreading it.

How does the answerer even know a Root Canal was Done.  Patients often misunderstand treatment even when it is spoken in their own native tongue.  

I can't count the number of time a patient has said ""I had a root canal last year.  yet on the X-ray there is no evidence of an root canal ever being done.   Patients misidentify Pulpal Therapy (pulpectomy) with Root Canals.   they go to the dentist.  The dentist is busy talking in dental tongue and he or she nods and goes home.   They go in with pain, go home out of pain,  "" oh , yeah must have been a root canal.""
that said.  Even the best Root canals even fail, done by the best Specialist.   You can't say so & so did wrong based on the patients impression.

I had to reply to you straight away, as I am 25 too, and two years ago had my 1st mild dyskaryosis smear result. I went back 6 months later. (It can clear up by the way, which is why they call you back in 6 months.) Mine did not. The 2nd smear also showed mild dyskaryosis. HPV was not tested for at this smear. I then had a colposcopy, which is not that bad. I went back again and was told that the biopsy showed moderate to severe dyskaryosis with HPV, so it was worse than I thought.

Apparently, once treated, problems rarely reoccur, but obviously, they keep a check on you. After my treatment, I went back 6 months later, then six months after that for smears. Both were clear and I now have to go every year for the next nine years to make sure.

I must say to you though, I HATE going for smears. I used to faint every time. Nearly fainted after the colposcopy too. So I was petrified.

Patients diagnosed neurogenic bladder usually dont totally recover. However, appropriate treatment may produce excellent results. Distinguishing between the hypotonic and the spastic neurogenic bladder is important because these conditions are treated differently. A patient diagnosed with neurogenic bladder will need continued monitoring for urinary tract infections and kidney function.

Treatment may include:

*insertion of a catheter or hollow tube (to empty the bladder at regular intervals)
*prophylactic (preventive) antibiotic therapy (to reduce the incidence of infection)
*placement of an artificial sphincter - a procedure that involves placing an artificial cuff around the neck of the bladder that can be inflated to prevent urinary incontinence and deflated when it is time to empty the bladder.

10,218962,Diagnosed Diabetes?,"Hello all, im new in the forums and to diabetes as well. However i have a Question i went to the doctor like a month ago due to a few palpitations i had (not related to diabetes i guess), and he ordered a bunch of tests for me to do.

In the Fasting one i had 92 on the sugar count (i have always been in the 85-95) range all my life, however he decided to make the glucose tolerance test, the reading i got when i got there was 91 then after the first hour i got 210 he said the maximun was 200, and then in the second hour i had 170 he said the maximun was 140, by the third hour i was back to 86. After seeing my results he said i was a Diabetic prescribed no meds only to lose weight (im like 40 pounds overweight) and exercise.

Im also been taking beta blockers a week and a half prior to the test (25mg every night) and i wondered if that may influence the test somehow, so what do you guys think?","Sorry, I don't know the answer to the beta blocker part of your question.  If you're continuing to take them I strongly suggest you do some online research; there's a lot of junk info to wade through, but it will give you a better idea of side effects, differing opinions, etc.

As to the diabetes diagnosis:  I think you've been diagnosed pre-diabetic.  If it were full-blown diabetes you WOULD be on medication.  I had the same diagnosis, and with some lifestyle changes (excuse the phrase) I brought my sugar back into the normal range within 3 months.  Some things to do:

1)  Avoid processed sugar and processed grains.  READ LABELS.  Lots of things have high fructose corn syrup in them.  And if the first ingredient is ""wheat flour"" it's been processed.  You're looking for bread whose first ingredient is ""whole wheat flour.""  It's not that you can never eat them, but try to avoid them whenever possible.  It's hard to do if you're eating out a lot.

2)  Increase your fiber intake, especially soluable fiber.  Oatmeal, apples, there's plenty of information about this on the internet.  Lots of soluable fiber helps your body regulate the insulin/sugar balance.

3)  Excercise.  A simple 20 minute walk after lunch or dinner.  Put on some music and dance.  You're not trying to buff up or lose weight, but to increase your metabolism.

4)  If you live where you can go to a reputable acupuncturist, I really recommend you give it a try.  It can really help balance your system, which is the goal you're aiming for.

5)  Take 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon every day.  This is not as nutty as it sounds.  There's some excellent research that it helps long term diabetics -- even my doctor had heard of it! -- and it can't hurt.

If you cut down on processed sugar and grain, and move you body more, you will lose weight, although slowly.  I would NOT recommend going on a diet of any sort, because you're trying to get your body to work in a more balanced and efficient way, and any kind of extreme eating is going to screw that up.

12,241434,Probability of spreading oral herpes?,"I have had fever blisters ever since i was little.  I've always been unsure of how contagious they are, and now I get the impression I could spread them to anybody I have intimate physical contact with.  Are they so contagious, even *without* an outbreak, that i need to tell everybody I've ever kissed before that they could potentially be spreading oral herpes as well as to other areas?  My fever blisters heal in two days with medication.  Is the healing time that quick for genital herpes?

People with a medical background answering this question would be more helpful...Thanks!","I am sorry to say but Mike is WRONG:
There are two types of Herpes,  Herpes simplex type I or II. Either type can infect the mouth or genitals (if you're really unlucky you can have 4 lifelong infections going at the same time: HSV1 and 2 in the upper body, HSV1 and 2 in the lower body. This would be very rare). When your incfected, the virus ""hides"" in the nervous system between outbreaks. It will protect you from a new infection of the same type, not of another type.
Only about 25% of Americans over the age of 12 DO NOT have antibodies against one of the two (standard test for exposure and infection).
HSV1 is extremely prevalent (very easy to pass on, quite innocently, just by an injudicious kiss to a baby). Most everybody (up to 90% of the population) has antibodies against HSV1 by the time they're 50.
About 20 to 30% of the population has antibodies against HSV2, more women than men (infection is easier for females), but HSV1 is fast becoming a major cause of genital herpes.
Most people with HSV1 have just ""fever blisters"". Some have it bad, a terrible rash from the nose down to the chest, inside the mouth, it looks like a case of pox. It can last a few days to over a week. Genital herpes is basically the same on the genitals, blisters and lesions, individually different how bad. 

Now about transmission: It mostly happens when you have a blister/blisters going, through direct skin-to-skin contact. Avoid physical contact with the area from the time of the first symptoms (tingling, itching, burning) until all sores are completely healed, not just scabbed-over. Also try to prevent self-infection to other areas of your body. Wash your hands with soap and water if you touch a sore. Better yet, don't touch the sores.
Unfortunately, the virus can sometimes  spread , when no signs or symptoms are present. This is called ""Asymptomatic Transmission."" Often people don't know they are infected, these people may have symptoms so mild they don't notice them at all or else don't recognize them as herpes. They can also spread it. Still, asymptomatic transmission appears to be far less likely than spreading the virus when lesions are present.",oral herpes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,Yes: Probability of spreading oral herpes?,,,,,,Not applicable,,,

She mentioned I'd have cramping and diarrhea. She also mentioned that it may help with weightloss.

I'd love to hear any experiences you may have had with this medication.  I pick mine up Friday.  It's 500mg a day with my largest meal.

Thanks.",i have been taking glucophage 2 a day for years. the research shows that as medicines go it is quite safe. it works by sensitising the receptors on the cell walls to take up sugar from the blood that the cells cannot do without glucophage. it DOES NOT pump out more insulin like a diferent kind of diabetes medicine. excess insulin in the blood damages cells so glucophage is good. just take your blood tests now and then to check your liver function just in case. andrew g is wrong. it does not cause sugar death and it is almost impossible to go into a coma like the wrong dose of insulin can do. sugar swings are smoothe. other meds that pump out insulin are worse than glucophage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,She mentioned I'd have cramping and diarrhea.,Glucophage,,,,,,,Yes: I was wondering if anyone else here was on it and what experiences they have had with it.,,,,,,No,,,Glucophage
12,1386614,General Anxiety Disorder?,"I am not sure I have GAD or not.

I have been having chronic insomnia for more than 10 years now.  I couldn't turn off my brain at night.  Even if i manage to fall to sleep, i would only sleep 6 to 7 hours at most and i feel dead tired in the morning.  (I generally need 9 hours of solid sleep each night in order to function properly the next day.)  BUT, if i go to bed (at or near bed time) just to lie down and rest (eg, before taking bath) without the intention of actually sleeping, i would fall to sleep pretty fast.  [Strange, I don't know why.]

I've been having this problem since 10 years ago, at which time i started to have the following feelings: (i) hopelessness, (ii) loneliness, (iii) anxiety, (iv) lack of energy, desire, etc

I am taking Remeron now, and, as a result, don't have any sleeping problem.  But, obviously I don't want to take it forever.

My questions are: 
(a) What's my problems? and 
(b) is Cognitive Behavioural Therapy the [better] answer to my problem?","Sounds like you might have a GAD-Depression combo (not exactly the two-for-one deal you were going for, huh?) A few things could be going on: the sleeplessness could be causing the anxiety and feelings of hopelessness (because, as I'm sure you know, not getting enough sleep can really mess you up), OR the anxiety and hopelessness could be causing your sleeplessness. 

I recommend going to the doctor (your regular doctor is fine) and telling him or her what's been going on. He or she may take you off the Remeron and put you on an antidepressant/antianxiety med, like Lexapro, which helps both those symptoms. Of course, the catch 22 in all of this is some of these meds cause insomnia, so your doctor may prescribe a light sleep aid to take before bedtime. 

As far as cognitive behavioral therapy, I'm not sure how much that would help you. Instead, your doctor may recommend talk therapy to help you cope with these feelings. Either way, be sure to talk with your doc first and get his or her opinion on the whole situation--and be very straightforward with what's going on. 

Personal tip: if you do end up taking another med that causes insomnia, try taking a Melatonin supplement in lieu of a prescription sleep aid. You can find it in the supplement aisle in any drug store. They come in 3mg and 5mg strengths. It also won't interfere with any other meds you might be taking, because melatonin is already produced in the brain. It's really made a difference for me :)

13,1483105,Lasik/Laser eye surgery?,"I have read a few questions and answers.  I am aware of prices and risks.  Can anyone who has had this surgery tell me about the prep before the surgery.  Someone said he had to wear his glasses for a few weeks right before he had it done.  And any other side effects other than the halo light?  Also, I read a few people said about only getting 1 eye done so they could read...I don't understand this?  Why only 1 eye, wouldn't it be blurry trying to see like that?  I know when I have 1 contact out it is not that easy to see.  But, anyways, I'd appreciate some opinions and feedback!  Thanks!
Prep","You'll need to wear your glasses (leave your contacts out) for two weeks prior to surgery (that's the FDA recommended waiting time for soft contact wearers -- it's longer for people with hard contacts of toric or RPG lenses).  This is necessary because your contact lenses change the shape of your eye; you want your eyes to get back to normal before they start up that laser, otherwise they'd be doing surgery on a surface that's still changing!

As for getting the eyes done together or at different times...

These days, most people who have Lasik get both eyes done at once.  If you have them done separately, you'll find that it isn't at all like when you take one lens out right now.  As soon as the surgery is over, you'll start seeing an improvement, so the vision in your ""corrected"" eye and the vision in the other eye (with the contact lens) are going to be a lot closer than you think. 

I got mine done 1 month apart because I was having PRK (which has a longer healing time) and they wanted to make sure that Eye #1 was responding well before doing Eye #2.  For two weeks before the second surgery, I had to wear my glasses, so I just popped one lens out of the frame.  It looked a little goofy but it was well worth it knowing I'd never have to wear those glasses or lenses again! 

Other than that, there's not much prep involved until you get to the doctor's office and they give you some drops and maybe some medication.

Afterwards, there can be side effects, some more likely than others.  Glare and halos are most common.  It's also possible that your vision may not become ""perfect"" afterwards, and you have to accept that possibility.  Mine isn't perfect, probably because my eyes were so horrible to begin with (-9) -- but I still consider this surgery the best thing I could ever have done for myself and my health!  Do I get halos?  Yes, at night, and I still say it's worth it!  Pick a doctor who has a great reputation.  Don't be afraid to google him or her to look into his credentials.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Also, I read a few people said about only getting 1 eye done so they could read...I don't understand this?",Lasik/Laser eye surgery,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes: Can anyone who has had this surgery tell me about the prep before the surgery.  ,,,,,,Yes: Whole Answer,,,Lasik/Laser eye surgery

20,241832,I live with a veteran who has a severe case of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.?,"Although I love him very much, living with him can sometimes be extremely difficult. He is just now starting to get professional help for PTSD, after being home for a year. I was just wondering if any one could give me some advice on how to help him at home too?

I always considered myself a very patient person, but when he's throwing his ""fits"" as we call them, it is extremely hard for me to not lose my temper also.","PTSD is such a difficult thing to deal with--for both the sufferer and those around them, as I'm sure you know. I'm glad your loved one is getting help (counceling, I hope, and meds.)

Many times, the majority of attention is paid to the sufferer and there is very little thought into how the caretaker is doing. Your health is just as important as his--you need to provide strength and have the will to help him through the roughest of times. 

I dealt with PTSD a few years ago, and though it wasn't nearly as bad as the trauma of war, I'm sure, it's stil hell. 

Have you ever had a nightmare where you swore it was real, then woke up and were so relieved it was just a dream? This is a diluted example of what PTSD is like--only it's all the time, day or night. He's probably reliving the trauma--people dying, constant uneasiness, being prepared for the worst at all times. 

I recommend making your home as much of a sanctuary for him as possible. Put on some soothing music, light a few lavender-scented candles and keep the atmosphere as calm as possible. The key here is to limit the amount of situations where he can become startled or be reminded of his time in the military, which may be what's leading to these ""fits."" 

Again, I'm so glad he's getting help, but be sure to monitor your health as well. If you feel overwhelmed, it might be time to see a councelor who can listen to and understand what you're going through.

I heard that cranberries were the ticket, so I've been eating and drinking all things cranberry, but yesterday I read that they are terrible.
I'm so confused!
Anyone ..........","My family has history of kidney stone and bladder stones.  It was very very painful for them as well as the relatives that took care of them watching them suffer.

It has then become a family practice to avoid these problems, so hopefully I can be some kind of help here.

Kidney stone or any kind of stone development is partly due to eating habit and behavior pattern.  So watchout on your diet and how you move about the day should solve this problem completely.

The stone is due to deposit of minerals in your body, most likely in your urine fluid.  There are also bacteria in your urine that will convert your urine into ammonia, which will help form these stones in your Kidney or bladder.  The stone takes anywhere from 4-6 years to form, as long as you take care of youself it shouldn't happen to you.

You should watching out your mineral intake such as calcium and magnesian (salt), just keep it balance and don't eat too much of it.  That should lower your mineral deposit in your fluid.  But don't go on a low-calcium diet, otherwise your body will be lack of calcium and other problem will arises.

You should also watch out for sitting down for a long period of time, since it will slow down your blood circulation in your lower back (kidney) area, just remember to get up and walk around for 5-10 mins every 45-60mins to help your blood circulate.  

Also if you sit down in a chair and lay back your back, it creates pressure / tension in your lower back part of your body.  Try not to lay backward when you sitting down and instead sit straight, a good posture would help your blood flow and ease tension in your lower back.

You also need to drink enough water during the day.  Having water constantly flowing through your body will dilute your urine and help your body get rid of mineral deposit through daily urine discharge.  

By diluting your urine you also decrease the chance of the bacteria converting your urine into ammonia, since your urine is not that concentrated and not much to convert.

The last thing to do is exercise regularly, like jogging / swimming or some kind of sport 2-3 times a week to keep the body in shape.  A good cardiovascular exercise that would boost blood circulation will definitely help you prevent any disease.

Hope this helps.",,,,,,,,,"  I've heard they are painful, and I DON'T do pain, so I need to avoid these!",kidney stones,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes: Anyone know how to prevent kidney stones?,,,,,,Yes: Whole Answer,,,kidney stones

Edema can be a reaction, and if he has edema, that can cause grave dangers, of which I am sure you are aware of.
Edema is the increase of interstitial fluid in any organ. Generally, the amount of interstitial fluid is in the balance of homeostasis. Increased secretion of fluid into the interstitium or impaired removal of this fluid may cause edema.

Generation of interstitial fluid is regulated by Starling equation of Tissue Fluid which states that it depends on the balance of osmotic pressure and of hydrostatic pressure across the capillary walls. Consequently, anything that increases oncotic pressure outside blood vessels (for example inflammation), or reduces oncotic pressure in the blood (states of low plasma osmolality, for example cirrhosis) will cause edema. Increased hydrostatic pressure inside the blood vessel (for example in heart failure) will have the same effect.

Abnormal removal of interstitial fluid is caused by obstruction of the lymphatic system, for example due to pressure from a cancer or enlarged lymph nodes, destruction of lymph vessels by radiotherapy, or infiltration of the lymphatics by infection such as elephantiasis.",,,,,,,,,He finished a rehab program several months ago but He looks really bad recently. ,"oxycodone, edema",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes:  I'm just wondering if these symptoms sound anything like what the oxycodone will do to you.,,,,,,Yes: Whole Answer,,,"oxycodone, edema"

Fact: Most women do not gain weight on the pill. But if you do it is likely to be water retention, limited to about 2 pounds. However, some women find the pill increases their appetite, which in turn causes overeating and weight gain. The solution: Switch to a different birth control pill. http://www.webmd.com/content/Article/105/107875.htm?pagenumber=3

I'm on the pill. Could it be making me fat? By Deb Levine, MA 

May 1, 2000 (San Francisco) -- There may be several reasons you put on weight while on the birth control pill. 
The hormones in the Pill (estrogen and progesterone) can alter water metabolism, sometimes causing fluid retention (called edema). A woman could experience a weight gain of up to five pounds from this temporary side effect that usually begins in the first month and lasts for four to six weeks. Decreasing your intake of salt could lessen this water gain, so you might want to cut down on chips, pretzels, and other salty foods when you're on the Pill. 
In addition, the hormones in some types of birth control pills can cause increased or decreased appetite, leading to weight gain or loss. If you notice a weight change, discuss it with your doctor during your next visit. 
You might also ask your doctor if you can switch to one of the pills that contains a lower dose of estrogen if you are not already taking one. According to a study of 463 women published in the March 13, 2000 issue of the journal Contraception, side effects such as bloating and breast tenderness were one-third less common in women taking lower-dose pills than those taking higher-dose ones, without a loss of effectiveness in preventing pregnancy. 
You should also report to your doctor any problem lasting more than two or three menstrual cycles. And if you have severe pain or swelling in the legs (thigh or calf), severe headache, dizziness, weakness, numbness, blurred vision (or loss of sight), speech problems, chest pain, shortness of breath, or abdominal pain, report them to your physician immediately. These symptoms could indicate a more serious condition such as a heart problem or abnormal blood clotting.

Fibromyalgia associated syndromes

It is not unusual for fibromyalgia patients to have an array of bodily complaints other than musculoskeletal pain. It is now thought that these symptoms are a result of the abnormal sensory processing ï¿½ as described in the previous section. Recognition and treatment of these associated problems are important in the overall management of your fibromyalgia. 

Non-restorative sleep
Cognitive dysfunction
Chronic fatigue
Cold intolerance
Restless leg syndrome
Multiple sensitivities
Irritable bowel syndrome
Dizziness
Irritable bladder syndrome
Neurally mediated hypotension

1. Chronic fatigue: The common treatable cause of chronic fatigue in fibromyalgia patients are: (1) inappropriate dosing of medications (TCAs, drugs with antihistamine actions, benzodiazapines etc.), (2) depression, (3) aerobic deconditioning, (3) a primary sleep disorder (e.g. sleep apnea), (4) non-restorative sleep (see above) and (5) neurally mediated hypotension (see below). A new drug called Provigil is of some help when used intermittently for management of fatigue.

2. Restless leg syndrome: This strictly refers to daytime (usually maximal in the evening) symptoms of (1) unusual sensations in the lower limbs (but can occur in arms or even scalp) that are often described as paresthesia (numbness, tingling, itching, muscle crawling) and (2) a restlessness, in that stretching or walking eases the sensory symptoms. This daytime symptomatology is nearly always accompanied by a sleep disorder - now referred to as periodic limb movement disorder (formerly nocturnal myoclonus). Treatment is simple and very effective ï¿½ DOPA / Levodopa (Sinemet) in an early evening dose of 10/100 (a minority require a higher dose or use of the long acting preparations).

3. Irritable bowel syndrome: This common syndrome of GI distress that occurs in about 20% of the general population is found in about 60% of fibromyalgia patients. The symptoms are those of abdominal pain, distension with an altered bowel habit (constipation, diarrhea or an alternating disturbance). Typically the abdominal discomfort is improved by bowel evacuation. Due to abnormal sensory processing these symptoms may be quite distressing to fibromyalgia patients. Treatment involves (1) elimination of foods that aggravate symptoms, (2) minimizing psychological distress, (3) adhering to basic rules for maintaining a regular bowel habit, (4) prescribing medications for specific symptoms; constipation (stool softener, fiber supplementation and gentle laxatives such as bisacodyl), diarrhea (loperamide or diphenoxylate) and antispasmodics (dicyclomine or anticholinergic / sedative preparations such as Donnatal).

4. Irritable bladder syndrome: This is found in 40-60% of fibromyalgia patients. The initial incorrect diagnoses are usually recurrent urinary tract infections, interstitial cystitis or a gynecological condition. Once these possibilities have been ruled out a diagnosis of irritable bladder syndrome (also called female urethal syndrome) should be considered. The typical symptoms are those of suprapubic discomfort with an urgency to void, often accompanied by frequency and dysuria. In a sub-population of fibromyalgia patients this is related to a myofascial trigger point in the pubic insertion of the rectus abdominus muscles ï¿½ and may be helped by a procaine myofascial trigger point injection).

About a week and a half later I started my period, but it was much shorter and lighter than usual...it is usually 5 days of heavy bleeding, but now it was only 2 days of light bleeding. This week I had another period and it too was much shorter and lighter than usual. In addition, I passed a large bit of what looked like tissue. I have also been experiencing dull stomach and side pains, extreme fatigue, bloating and lower back pain...which kind of sound like early pregnancy symptoms to me, but I figured since I had a period and I took a negative pregnancy test, that it must not be that.

I posted a question about this procedure, it was agony, and I was in hospital for two weeks over Xmas.  It did not improve, in fact pain was worse than pre-op, so had me back in March 17th for 4th nerve root block.  That kicked in after about 3 weeks.  I would NOT recommend any surgery whatsoever on the spine or spinal cord, until you have tried every, I mean, ever other avenue, including chiropractice, physiotherapy, osteopathy, and a whole bunch of specially programmed exercises.  Keep mobile.  I am about half way back to where I was before surgery, and they tell me it will be a year before I really benefit (!). I am very sceptical.  I did not receive one single answer to my question regarding decompression, therefore I assume either readers don't know what it is, or they haven't had it done.  Ive had some silly answers and some very good advice but NOT FOR post op disc decompression, sadly.  You don't say how old your wife is?  I was 59 when mine started to exacerbate after a 23 hour flight to Sydney from UK to see my daughter.  I knew something was terribly wrong, and had three months of agony over there.  What treatment has been suggested to your wife?  I cannot see how it will improve unless something is done quickly for her, such as physiotherapy and/or exercises.  The pain from sciatica is notoriously difficult to keep under control.  Not even morphine pathes helped in the end.  It's a condition she will have to nurse along very carefully, always pacing herself.  Perhaps it will improve and heal itself, but only if she is very careful.  I wish her very quick healing indeed.

It's basically a ""pyramid"" workout and this is what you do:

1. Choose the exercise you want to work on.  The first set of repetitions you do, do 12-15 reps on the lightest weight you want to use.  Rest about 30 seconds before you do the next set of repetitions.
2. The second set of repetitions do 8-12 reps with a slightly heavier weight, but not too heavy.  Rest again for 30 seconds and get ready for the 3rd set.
3. Third set choose the heaviest weight you can do (without hurting yourself) but only do 4-8 reps this time.  Rest again for 30 seconds and then move onto the next completely different exercise and repeat this process of pyramiding up again.

Do your entire workout 2-3 times with each different exercise and you will see results quickly. Remember to drink plenty of water and just concentrate on fruits and vegetables and lean protein while you are on this until you have a great time on your vacation.

42,780455,"Which is the bigger problem?  Obesity, or aneorexia?","Apparently the pressure is on young women everywhere that they have to be as skinny as inhumanly possible to be sexy, but end up being undesirable because they just end up looking dead.  Conversely, being fat is also nothing to be ashamed about, because most of it is ""genetic"" anyway, and there's no point in trying to change who you are (even if that means succumbing to diabetes).  Which is worse; being too skinny or being too fat?","Today, 64.5 percent of adult Americans (about 127 million) are categorized as being overweight or obese. Each year, obesity causes at least 300,000 excess deaths in the U.S., and healthcare costs of American adults with obesity amount to approximately $100 billion.

Recent studies on the epidemiology of anorexia have suggested an incidence of between 8 and 13 cases per 100,000 persons per year and an average prevalence of 0.3% using strict criteria for diagnosis. These studies also confirm the view that the condition largely affects young adolescent females, with females aged between 15 and 19 making up 40% of all cases. Furthermore, the majority of cases are unlikely to be in contact with mental health services.

While it was once thought that obesity was largely due to genes, it is not the case so much today.  Many people are eating for more reasons than sustaining hunger; psychological or mental disorders play a part, lack of activity, inadequate nutrients replace the nutritional value the body needs (i.e., fat burgers, fried foods, etc.).

With so few reporting their anorexic condition to the medical field, it is difficult to gauge numbers that would be in comparison to obesity to measure hospital costs, etc.

Personally, I think both conditions are problematic but would say that obesity is a bigger problem due to the NUMBER of individuals it has plagued.  WIth insufficient data to compare, it seems though, unlikely, that there are that many suffering from anorexia (by viewing physical appearance) than that of obese people (there seem to be more and more waddling around these days - and they are younger than before).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,I am not sure about this question in general.,,Obesity

0,54406,Why are people so quick to suggest pills as an answer to depression and other mental illness?,"Many times pills are not actually needed.  Out of 100 perscriptions a doctor writes, 5-10 of them may actually be necessary.  In many cases these drugs can worsen your health metally and physically.  Sometimes, I think,  people just need some time to figure things out.  I realize this is not always the case as I have stated above.  Some people are deffinitely in need of meds.  Before you take any drug you should do some research to see if the benefits outweigh the negative effects. These drugs cause serious side effects and are not always necessary.  That's the bottom line.","I think we live in a society who have come to think the solutions to all of life's problems comes in the form of a substance of one form or another.  Sometimes it is, and sometimes not.  I went through my own period of severe depression after my sister was killed.  I felt like my world had ended.  After months of downward spiraling, I decided to go to a doctor because the suicide thoughts were scaring me.  I wanted help.  I was given a prescription anti-depressant, and who knows, maybe that saved me.  I didn't feel good though.  I didn't really feel anything.  I didn't care for that.  I didn't like the other side effects either.  I stayed on them for a few months but eventually got off of them.  I struggled with depression for years afterward (about four).  It varied in degrees.  Sometimes I couldn't get out of bed, sometimes I could function.  I always felt a sense of impending doom.  Talking about how I felt with my friends and family helped a great deal, and time helped too.  But NOTHING helped as much as adopting a regular exercise program.  I eventually began running on an elliptical trainer at the gym for 45 minutes 3-5 days a week, and I was amazed at how great I felt.  It made me feel well-balanced and gave me a sense of well-being.  You hear it all of the time, ""exercise is important"".  I'll tell you, it is the only thing that helped me kick a serious bout of depression.

I do know how you feel.  Unfortunately there is not much you can do aboout this particular cold sore.  But there is something you can do in the future.  

The cold sore virus is from the same family of viruses that causes genital herpes.  Once you have the cold sore virus it is always in your body.  It comes out in times of stress or when your immune system is a bit weak, such as now when you are sick, or if you get too much sun, or if you are very anxious about something.

I don't know how old you are so I don't know if you can sort this yourself.  There is a prescription medication called Valtrex that attacks the cold sore virus.  It was actually developed for genital herpes, but it works wonderfully for the cold sore virus too.  YOu take it at the first tingle of a cold sore and it stops the cold sore in its tracks and stops it from developing.  I used to get cold sores badly.  My family doc prescribed this medication about 5 years ago, and since the first time I took it I haven't had a bad cold sore.  YOu don't have to take it all the time - only for a day or two when you first feel the tingle of a cold sore.  YOu don't have to take the whole prescription as you would if it was for gential herpes.  

I would not consider any other treatment now that I see how effectively this one has worked for me.  The otehr things you see advertised for cold sores do not actually attack the virus - they just help soothe the symptoms.

I have attached a website that will tell you more about this medication.

We have been to the doctor twice, the symptoms continue.  We have tried over-the-counter medications as well as prescriptions.  What could this be?

Still could be GERD(reflux) If GERD is bad enough it can cause respiratory symtpoms. Clearing of the throat is one of the #1 symptoms I hear patients complain of with GERD. You do not always have esophageal burning. He needs a Ph probe or a Nasopharyngoscopy to completely rule out GERD.

Symptoms: frequent cough or clearing of throat, always feeling something in your throat, burning feelin in throat. sore throat, hoarseness/change in voice possibly, if GERD is severe acid may bubble over into the trachea causing asthma like symptoms

Treatments within your control other than medication are:
Don't eat right before bedtime
Decrease alcohol, coffee, and chocolate consumption. Lose weight(if that is an issue), Don't wear tight fitting clothes. Don't eat acidic food citrus fruits, tomato sauce etc. Raise the head of your bed 30-45 degrees. 

My ENT always recommended Gaviscon liquid 1 hour before bedtime. In severe case the esophagus and trachea can be damaged from acid reflux.

I don't know about professional info but I can give you my experience which is kind of the opposite of yours.   My husband is Bi-polar and has only spent a total of 3 months on medication in the last 3 years since he was diagnosed.  I have known him for 14 years (since we were kids) so I have seen a lot of the progressions of this disease.  

My son has ADHD and emotional/psychological issues with changes in his routine (I understand this is more severe with autism).  There have been some problems when my husband has been manic and it disrupts our home-life, and then the hospital stays, yes I am familiar with those stresses.

My husband tried various medications after hospitalization but didn't like them and never gave them time to work.  However now his on Lithium and doing well with his therapy.

Now to turn the tables...
If your ex refuses medication he will likely never be able to provide any stable support.  You probably know this already.  If his past behavior shows a pattern of irrationality, instability and especially if he has attempted suicide then most courts would agree that he could potentially pose a threat to your son.  If your pediatricial would be able to put into writing that your son requires an absolute routine and that his fathers symptoms of the uncontrolled bopolar disorder are too disruptive then that should be enough to atleast get a hearing.  

Look into the standard step-parent adoption to get started (it is much easier than a traditional adoption).  If you think your ex might possibly sign-off on an uncontested adoption I would try that.  If he is more likely to fight you on it then use the information that you know from his past issues as a basis for your arguement.

Even though I've never really been 'diagnosed' with depression, I deffinitely know its worse them most peoples. I just hate making a big deal about things. Earlier this year I tried to kill myself, but when my therapist asked if I needed to be committed, I declined.. because I just don't want to be a problem to people.. Do you think that mental health disorders are real? ADHD, is that just a kid who doesn't listen and needs his ass beaten, like my dad says. Depression, is that just someone who makes themselves depressed, as he says as well? Even though I know he's OCD and so am I, so why would he accept that?","Yes , mental disorders are real. Ask yourself this: If it's possible to have a heart disorder of some kind, then why would it not be possible for the brain to have disorders? The problem with the brain disorders is that they manifest themselves through behavior most times. Unlike most physical ailments that manifest themselves through some physical illness/disability/failure. Since behavior is not physical in nature it is hard for some to understand that there is indeed a real physical problem with the brain. It makes me angry that your father could be so ignorant, at best he'll do you no good, at worst he could possibly harm you by his careless misunderstanding of mental illness.

ADHD is very real as well, kids don't make that up, it would be too difficult for a child to manage faking such an illness.

Depressed people don't ""make"" themselves depressed, again, it comes from a chemical (real physical) imbalance in the brain that manifests itself through behavior, thought, and emotions.

I think your father is narrow minded and chooses to remain ignorant when it would be easy enough to educate himself about these things on the internet. Ignorance by choice is simple stupidity. Since mental illness by it's very nature is intangable, I think many people do not have either the capacity to understand or simply choose to remain ignorant because to truly understand mental illness takes quite a bit of clarity of thought and understanding. The tangible is much easier to deal with as it's right there before your eyes, you see the effects, whereby with mental illness you feel the effects and it's inherent side effects it has on your behavior and thought processes, but there's nothing to put your hands on, nothing to see.

It sounds as if you have been questioning an addiction or over usage of her pain pills for a while now and truth is, although sometimes pain medication is required, unless she is under extreme pain she shouldn't be using the precribed pain medication as her only treatment and it shouldn't be needed on a daily basis.  I endured years of endometriosis and if the endometriosis is so severe as to require so many pain pills ... it may be best to seek another alternative treatment.

As with any assumptions, it is wrong to assume that she is giving false information to her physicians unless of course you have positive proof of this.  Yet, with an addiction to prescribed pain medications it is very possible that one will exaggerate the intensity of their pain and/condition to further their cravings for the drug.  She also may be taking prescriptions that have conflicting effects which could be causing her drowsiness as well as many other problems.  Speak to her openly and if you feel you are certain she has an addiction, try speaking to a family member who may be able to assist you in helping her if that is what course needs to be taken.  If she is abusing the rx's...she needs help but if she isn't, she needs your friendship and comfort more than anything.  Good Luck...

If so, don't worry.  The natural progression from pre-cancerous cells to actual cancer of the cervix can take 5 to 15 years.  Make sure you get treatment and a follow-up smear.  Secondly, the inflammation of cells on your cervix caused by the gonorrhoea could be mistaken for pre-cancerous cells.  What you probably need is treatment for the infection followed by a repeat smear 6 months from now.  Your doctor may also want you to attend a coloposcopy clinic to have a closer look at your cervix.  The only way this could effect your future pregnancies is if you need a cone biopsy of the cervix which is unlikely from what you have told me.
With regard to the infection, any infection effecting the pelvic organs can effect your chances of getting pregnant and increases your risk of an ectopic pregnancy.  That said, lots of women have infections for years and still have no problems at all. Worse case scenario is you have difficulty getting pregnant but then IVF treatment nowadays would solve your problem and has good success rates.  So basically, get yourself treated and try not to worry.",,,,,,,,,i'm worried that i may not be able to have children because they both hold some risks in infertility,infertility,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes: can i still get pregnant?,,,,,,No,,,pregnant

 ARTHRITIS - OSTEOARTHRITIS/ RHEUMATOID
 
 
Arthritis is inflammation of one or more joints, usually accompanied by pain, stiffness, swelling, loss of function and over time, changes in structure. Arthritis is associated with many diseases including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, lupus erythematosus, Lyme disease, psoriasis, scleroderma, Reiter's syndrome, Sjogren's syndrome, and ankylosing spondylitis.

Symptoms
Osteoarthritis, usually found in elderly people, develops mainly as a result of the continuous wearing away of the cartilage in a joint. It is the most prevalent form of arthritis. It is characterised by pain and stiffness (especially after exercise), swelling, deformity, and/or a diminished range of motion. 
Bone growths or spurs may develop on the margins of affected joints, increasing pain and decreasing mobility. There may be audible cracking or grating noises when the joint moves. 

Rheumatoid arthritis causes stiffness (especially in the mornings), swelling, and, often, crippling pain. It may also cause fatigue, anaemia and weight loss. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder: it is a ""self-attacking-self"" disease. The body's immune system improperly identifies the synovial membranes as foreign. Inflammation results, damaging cartilage and tissues in and around the joints. Normal spaces within the joints become narrowed and the bones may even fuse together.

Causes
The causes of osteoarthritis can be injury or an inherited defect in the protein that forms cartilage. Mostly, it is a result of the wear and tear related to ageing, diet and lifestyle. Risk factors include obesity, overuse or abuse of joints as in sports or strenuous occupations, and trauma.

The underlying cause of rheumatoid arthritis is unknown.

Natural Therapies
The application of proper diet, and lifestyle changes, combined with nutritional supplements may relieve the inflammation, pain and slow-down degeneration of the affected joints.
Glucosamine- Clinical trials show that glucosamine may help reduce joint inflammation and swelling, increase joint mobility and provide temporary relief of the pain of osteoarthritis. 
Blackmores Lyprinolï¿½ is a natural anti-inflammatory supplement containing a unique patented marine extract. Its potent anti-inflammatory action assists in the maintenance of healthy airways and breathing passages, and may provide relief from joint swelling and arthritis.
Fish Oil 1000 contains omega-3 fatty acids which provide an anti-inflammatory action within the body which may be beneficial for the relief of inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis
 
 Important Notes

If you suspect you are suffering from arthritis, prompt diagnosis will help to determine the type, and therefore, the right treatment and prevention. 

Food allergies may be a cause for some individuals especially if there is only occasional joint pain. An elimination diet, or allergy diet, may be necessary to determine which foods are the offending allergens.

Arthritis is sometimes described as just a symptom of an underlying condition. If you are suffering from arthritis, it is imperative to investigate the health of all the different systems of the body, especially the health of the digestive, circulatory and immune systems. Arthritis is a complex, and also very individual condition requiring individual attention.



Prevention

Exercise is important in both the prevention and treatment of arthritis . It improves muscle strength and maintains mobility.

Overweight and obesity also affect the weight bearing joints, which become irritated and stressed by having to carry too much of a load.

Correct posture is also important in avoiding body weight to be distributed unevenly, and causing stiffness and crippling.

54,2935733,Miscarriage?,"Ok I miscarried the end of last month.  I was told that we need to becareful and wait three months before TTC again. 

Signs of pregnancy subsided. We haven't been as careful as we should have been. I haven't had my period yet. And now,  I am having pms/pregnancy signs again. 

Hypothetically speaking when can a woman get pregnant again?
  
When can I expect my period again? 

Can you get pregnant before your next period, after the miscarriage? Don't you need to ovulate before you have your period? In order to have a period you need to expel blood/old egg...right? I don't understand how this works (In regards to a miscarriage and resuming normal function)

I think it's just PMS, but it's something I want to know. I will be careful going forward...I, of course, want a healthy baby so I am going to way the 3 months.  (This was my first baby/miscarriage)","When i miscarried my period came the very next month when it was due.
your health after miscarriage 

HCG Levels
Most women can expect their levels to return to a non-pregnant range about 4 - 6 weeks after a pregnancy loss has occurred. This can differentiate by how the loss occurred (spontaneous miscarriage, D&C procedure, abortion, natural delivery), and how high the levels were at the time of the loss.
Health care providers usually will continue to test HCG levels after a pregnancy loss to ensure they return back to 5.0. 

tiredness
It is normal to feel emotionally and physically drained following a miscarriage. If possible take a few days off work, and if you can't, make sure you get to bed early, plan rests where possible and postpone anything that isn't urgent.
Make yourself your first priority. 

bleeding
If your miscarriage is complete, you can expect your bleeding to taper off rapidly, i.e. over the next week it should get lighter and lighter and stop. All bleeding and spotting should have stopped by seven days. If it persists or is heavier than a normal period, this indicates something is wrong, see your doctor. While you are still bleeding it is important that you shower, not bath, and that you do not swim in public pools because of the risk of contracting an infection.

pain
When the miscarriage is complete, or after a D&C all pain should cease. Again, see your doctor if you have continuing pain.

temperature
Temperature indicates infection which can result in infertility. If you have one see your doctor urgently. You will be treated with antibiotics and possibly a D&C (or repeat D&C). 

discharge
If you are having an offensive discharge this could also indicate infection so get checked out. 

lactation
This is normal if the pregnancy has lasted longer than 12 weeks and will stop by itself. 

menstrual cycle
Ovulation can occur 14 days after a miscarriage with the next period 28 days after the miscarriage, but there is great personal variation. It may take a few cycles before your regular pattern is re-established. This means that you can become pregnant 14 days after a miscarriage if you resume a normal cycle immediately, but there is a great personal variation. It can take up to 6 or 7 weeks for your next period to come if you had ""natural"" miscarriage (i.e. no D&C or tablets). 

sex
Sexual intercourse should be avoided until bleeding has stopped to prevent the risk of infection. Even though your cervix will be closed again, sperm can travel up through it and introduce infection into the uterus, which is still healing. 

contraception
If you do not wish to become pregnant immediately, you should start using contraception straight after the miscarriage. Note: The pill should be commenced at the time of the miscarriage. You will not be safe until you have taken the tablets for 14 days. 

the physical symptoms of grief
Many women find they experience physical symptoms of grief as well as the emotional aspects. These vary greatly from person to person, and include: 
disturbed sleep and eating patterns 
unexplainable tiredness 
unexpected tears 
disturbing dreams and mental confusion

Be gentle and patient with yourself during this time and take comfort in knowing that these symptoms are normal.

You can get pregnant right away...you are more fertile after you have a miscarriage or giving birth.

My doctor told me to wait 2 months before trying again but i haven't.
So sorry for your loss.

59,3284225,"Bloating or IBS or Celiac Disease or Rapid Weight Gain...I'm so confused, answers please!?","I'm a 20 year old female and for the past two months I've been bloated (at least I think).  I lost 10lbs in that last two months but in the past two weeks I've gained 6lbs.  All of a sudden, and I really mean it, I've noticed maybe fat or muscle on my hips because normally my hip bones stick out or are noticeable.  After anything I eat or drink in any amount I bloat up and look like I'm three months pregnant, I don't get it.  Even when I wake up in the morning I feel bloated but yet I'm starving (I'm normally a very hungry person).  I noticed the waist band on my work pants are a little tight...but how could that happen in like two weeks?  I have actually been eating healthier!  Also, I've never had any known allergies but one week in October all of a sudden I guess I got allergies, lol.  Yesterday I think I broke out with a rash after eating or working out, I don't know which one but my face was hot, red, and itchy along my jawline...any suggestions?  It won't let me type anymore :(","It could be celiac, but doesn't scream it or anything.  It would explain the bloating, the weight fluctuations, being hungry all the time.  Celiac is very common -- 1 in 133 people in the US have it, but only 97% of them know it.  There is a rash that goes along with celiac, but that almost sounds like a food allergy reaction rather than celiac.  You can also have an allergy to wheat which is a different reaction than celiac, which is an autoimmune reaction and not an allergy.  Celiac can and does come out of the blue.  Most people with celiac can tell you exactly when their symptoms started.  

BUT, it does sound like you're reacting to something you're eating.   It could be anything from celiac or a true food allergy, to an intolerance or sensitivity.

You said that you had started eating healthier.  Before I found out about having celiac myself, every time I made the resolution to eat healthier I got sick because I heard that eating things such as whole grains and wheat grass were healthy.  Sick as a dog.  If you're concerned that you may be having an issue with gluten, keep in mind that spelt, kamut and sprouted wheat all have gluten in them, no matter what people at the health food store may say (it's a common mistake).  

Some of the other things that are common foods that are also the top food allergens are - soy, dairy, peanuts, other nuts (such as almonds, cashews, walnuts, pecans), eggs, fish, shellfish.  

Dairy can cause some of the same issues as celiac.  There is a protein in dairy called casein that is a seperate reaction than lactose.  It's relatively common for people with celiac to not only be gluten free, but casein free.  

Soy is also a very common thing to react to which is touted as a health cure-all.  There was a while where I had a sensitivity to it and it tore me up.  I'm fine with it now, but for a few months it really messed me up.  It's also difficult to avoid because it's another one of those things that's in everything nowadays.  

Well, I hope this helps.

64,3517296,Is this something neurological or vascular?,"I was biten by a stray cat on Thursday of last week. I had it picked up by Animal Control on Saturday and quarantined. 

Today, I suddenly experienced pain in the back of my head, pain in my right eye, pain in my right leg and the acute, sudden appearance of a black blob/box in the middle of my visual field.

I also felt weak all over, my chest felt heavy and I felt a vague ""blah"" feeling all throughout my hands, arms and shoulders (I was bitten on the left hand and all these symptoms seemed to have arisen in the right side of my body).

The doctor at the ER was sufficiently concerned to order a CAT scan. It turned out normal.

However, he cautioned me to keep on eye on things and to check back with Animal Control to see how the cat is doing (thus far, after nearly 4 days in quarantine, animal control has not contacted me in any way).

I am taking antibiotics as prescribed (Amoxicillin) and received a Tetanus injection the same day as my cat bite.

Just because he wore a condom doesn't mean that he didn't catch herpes Whether you have symptoms or not, you can still transmit the infection.

Genital herpes (also called HSV infection) is a viral infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). It is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) that may cause skin blisters and sores in the genital area, but often causes no visible symptoms.

I started having severe headaches, stomach cramping, feeling like I was going to throw up, etc....I stopped taking it and started taking a normal multi-vitamin where it says 18mgs is the 100% needed each day, so my gawd, I was taking a LOT. This may seem strange, but while I was on that high dose, I started having light vaginal bleeding, but as soon as I stopped taking that high dose, the vaginal bleeding stopped. Has anyone ever heard of this as a side effect of taking way too much ferrous sulfate??? I know it can cause blood in your stools, so was wondering. Just seems to strange to just be a coincidence. Thanks for any input!!","If you are anemic, you need more than 18 mg of extra iron.  Your body needs much more iron.  Your doctor prescribed what he felt was best.  Also, there are different forms of iron and each one has different milligram dosage requirements for the same effect.  

There are other iron supplements available and in many price ranges.  I take the ferrous sulfate 325 mg now because it is cheap.  But, I do not like it as much as Niferex 150 Forte.  The Niferex with my insurance is $10 a month while the FS is $2 a month.  The Niferex 150 Forte and Ferrous Sulfate 325 mg. are supposed to be equivalent dosages.

When I first started taking Iron, I took the Niferex.  I had to use the ladies room every 45 minutes  for about what seemed like a week.  But, after that, I was normal.  The Niferex regulated me.  

The ferrous sulfate is okay.  But, I do not feel as good using it.  I also take it only every other day or so.  This is because it made me very constipated.  I think I did experience some of the side effects on a short term basis.  I never had the extra vaginal bleeding.  

I am anemic because I had about 15 years of severe periods due to Polycystic Ovararian Syndrome.  So, the extra iron may be beneficial for someone to have a normal period which may account for your light vaginal bleeding.  

I am now back on the Niferex because I felt so much better using it.  I know I said that I take the FS now because it is cheap.

80,4275471,earring infection & pus HELP?,"i got my ears pierced again so that each earlobe has 2 holes. 
i always mess around and never leave the gold ones in long enough so there are always problems. 

the upper hole on my right ear was hurting and swelling, so i took out the earring (it has plastic pole, so it's not those cheap metal). there's a bump in it, so i knew there's pus in there. i squeezed most the pus out (there was a lot), but it's still swollen. 
It hurts when i try to put the post back in, but if i leave it out, the hole will close...

what should i do? i can't change the past so please don't reply ""you should have...""

thanks guys...","simply: hydrogen peroxide, if you MUST keep the earring in (which i don't recommend) clean the earring with rubbing alcohol before putting it back in. don't mess with your ear lobe (that'll just irritate it and make it hurt worse than it already does. be sure to clean any earrings you might have worn while it was infected. once it's cleared up, be sure to clean your earrings regurlarly with rubbing alcohol to prevent infection, especially if you seem prone to infection in the earring hole.",,,,,,,,,"It hurts when i try to put the post back in, but if i leave it out, the hole will close...",ear infection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes: what should i do? ,,,,,,No,,,earring infection
81,4276498,Why am I still having flank pains?,"I had a UTI which spread to my kidneys back in March this year.  After four weeks, I had taken Cipro,Penicillin, and my CT scan was negative.  Ever since, I have been experiencing flank pains (dull), without fever, malaise or chills.  I am concerned that there is some sort of kidney damage here.  Is it common to have echos of the flank pains after having such a severe infection?  Any advice will help!","your symptoms are not abnormal, but not common either.  Gerota's fascia around the kidney is full of nerves, and they take a while to ""quiet"" down so to speak.  

Some with chronic pain, may have stretched these fibers to the point where they cannot recover completely, and continue to give off ""false"" pain signals as they try to recover (a layman's explaination for sure).... a bad situation, kidney's have been removed for this type of chronic pain (rare).

If march 06, I wouldn't worry too much.  As allowed by your doctor would use motrin/tylenol combo before the pain starts for about 3 weeks, whether it hurts or not.  After a week of constant use, motrin has anti-inflamatory effects.  Otherwise it is a pain medicine only.  Doctors think the key is to reduce the overall ""inflamtatory"" environment of the kidney.",,,,,,,,," I am concerned that there is some sort of kidney damage here.

You can also get injections into the joint that will take away the pain (they hurt a bit but are worth it if it helps).

Your teeth will be sensitive to cold and hot beverages until your teeth get the treatment but It's not going to go away over night. It's going to take a month or two of continous brushing, flossing, and useing Listerine at least twice a day. Make sure you see your dentist reguarly like every 2-3 months to get it under control.

I was also taking Gonal F and Pergonyl with Progesterone supposatories at the end of my cycle.

The success rate varies from fertility clinic to fertility clinic and depends on each couple and their fertility stats.  My doctor told me that I had a 30% chance of getting pg every month.  Which is a lot higher than the regular pregnancy rate!

BTW, it was the hugely botched cycle that I conceived on!  So, even if it isn't perfectly timed (we were off by THREE days) you still have a chance.  Just keep getting busy!

I have always been shy but I think that my shyness is something more serious.  I don't get the anxiety, panic attacks or tremors that people with Social Anxiety Disorder get, but I'm more than just ""shy"" when it comes to talking with people, especially females.

The only main thought in my head is ""Don't F*** this up!!!!"".  By doing this, I put intense pressure on myself.  A girl could tell me her name and it won't even come close to being remembered because the only thing I am thinking is ""Is she interested in talking to me?"" or ""she probably thinks I'm an idiot"".

It's funny, I won't shut the hell up in front of people I know or in a setting where I know I will be funny/ liked but the second you put me with a stranger, I can't communicate.

Is this something I should talk to my physician about?  Perhaps a therapist?  Not sure where the best place for help is...","Sounds to me like you suffer from low self esteem.  You don't think you're good enough for other people to like you, so you are worried that they won't.  You are so obsessed with what they think of you, that you aren't even paying attention to them.  So, they probably won't like you...no one likes to be ignored when they are talking, which will only make your problem worse.

Nerves can be bad, but there is no magic pill that will fix what your problem is.  Only practice can help.  Don't worry about what the other person thinks about you.

I get constant post nasal drip, and it's really dry feeling.  They're always swollen and it's difficult to breath.  

I was put on antibiotics first, that didn't work. Then I was put on 3 different nasal sprays, not sure what they were but I know there were steriods in some of them, they didn't help.  I am currently using what is called a Netti Pot, which you put a mixture of salt water in and run it through your nose, and that helps the soothing.  But nothing FIXES!! Please someone tell me what I need to do!!","The thing with the neti pot is that you must continue to do it.  It's not going to ""fix"" you.  Western medicine encourages us to think we can find a pill to ""fix"" us, but generally it's lifestyle changes that make us healthier.  I don't know about what lifestyle changes would help you, but perhaps a naturopath or ayuvedic physician would.

I was, in fact, ""cured"" by nasal flushes.  But when things get dry, or if my allergies begin to act up, I need to flush daily.  When I feel an infection coming on, I do it twice a day, and when I have an infection, maybe even as frequently as hourly (it helps if you're home in bed drinking fresh organic vegetable broth and resting).  The mixture I use is 8 oz water w/ 1/4 tsp each baking soda and salt.  I don't use a neti pot, I use a baby nasal aspirator, but I don't know how important that difference is.

I am just tired of all this pain, I am so sick when I am on my period. What should I do??","I dont have endometriosis, but here is what i could find on it. Hope it helps you

The treatments for endometriosis pain include:
NSAIDs and other pain medication: They often work quite well as they not only reduce pain but also menstrual flow. They are commonly used in conjunction with other therapy. For more severe cases narcotic prescription drugs may have to be used.
Hormone suppression therapy: This approach tries to reduce or eliminate menstrual flow and estrogen support. Typically, it needs to be done for several months or even years. 
Progesterone or Progestins: Progesterone counteracts estrogen and inhibits the growth of the endometrium. Such therapy can reduce or eliminate menstruation in a controlled and reversible fashion. Progestins are chemical variants of natural progesterone.
Avoiding products with xenoestrogens, which have a similar effect to naturally produced estrogen and can increase growth of the endometrium.
Continuous birth control pills consists of the use of birth control pills without the use of placebo pills. This eliminates monthly bleeding episodes.
Danocrine is a suppressive steroid with some androgenic activity. Oral Danocrine inhibits the growth of endometriosis but its use is limited as it may cause hirsutism. There has been some research done at Case Western Reserve University on a topical Danocrine, applied locally, which has not produced the hirsutism characteristics. The study has not yet been published in a medical journal.
Gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists (GnRH agonists) induce a profound hypoestrogenism by decreasing FSH and LH levels. While quite effective, they induce menopausal symptoms, and over time may lead to osteoporosis. To counteract such side effects some estrogen may have to be given back (add-back therapy).
Surgical treatment is usually a good choice if endometriosis is extensive, or very painful. Surgical treatments range from minor to major surgical procedures. 
Laparoscopy is very useful not only to diagnose endometriosis, but to treat it. With the use of scissors, cautery, lasers, hydrodissection, or a sonic scalpel, endometriotic tissue can be ablated or removed in an attempt to restore normal anatomy.
Laparotomy can be used for more extensive surgery either in attempt to restore normal anatomy, or at least preserve reproductive potential.
The definitive treatment for endometriosis is a total hysterectomy (removal of the uterus and surrounding tissue) and bilateral salpingoophorectomy (removal of the uterine tubes and ovaries).
For patients with extreme pain, a presacral neurectomy may be indicated where the nerves to the pelvis are cut.
A variety of alternative treatments are being used in patients with endometriosis, including acupuncture and nutrition.

Patients who are pregnant generally have less pain during pregnancy, and it is not unusual to have fewer symptoms after a pregnancy.

The only other suggestion I can make is try a hot water bottle. Just make sure it's not too hot, and rest it on your stomach before you go to bed.

They have ingredients that incapsulate the bacteria so it cannot attach and multiply, and so that you can easily urinate the bacteria out.

Up your water intake so that you are peein like a mad man!  Once the pain goes away, continue with the cranberry/water regimen for a few more days.

38,678939,I like everything about my new girlfriend apart from she's overweight. What should I do?,It's not just from a looks point of view (I think she's cute actually) but more from a fitness concern. She says she is going to go to the gym but doesn't seem to be doing anything about it. She doesn't eat heaps (around me anyway) but she doesn't have a high metabolism either. I enjoy tramping and getting outdoors in genral and she says she likes the same but she always finds an excuse not to go and I think it's because she's afraid she can't keep up. I have never criticised her about her weight but I feel I may say something soon and I want it to be the right thing.,"First of all, to the guy who said ""get another girl..a slim one of course"" you are mean, and didn't even address the question. Not everyone is as superficial as you are.

Now, if you think she's cute, and are mostly dissapointed that you can't enjoy physical activities with her because she always finds excuses not to go, then I suggest that you kindly explain to her that its something you really enjoy, and something you want her to be a part of, and that you can take it slow if she wants. I think you're right about her being afarid she won't be able to keep up (thats how I'd feel) 

You could also just stop by her house and ask her to take a walk with you, or take her to go swimming at a lake or something...activities that are romantic as well as counting as excersise. Once she is able to be comfortable around you in these sort of situations, she'll agree to them more and more, and most likely start to lose a bit of weight. 

And if she says she goes to the gym, why not suggest that the two of you go together? 

Just keep in mind that healthy weight loss takes a lot or work, pateince and time - and this applies to you as well as her. Be supportive and don't get impatient.

41,2718006,What are some warning signs of skin cancer?,"Well, I've been dating the same guy since the end of January.  He doesn't spend a lot of time in the sun and just recently started because I love it.  I've noticed, now that he has a tan, some white spots on his back.  He has a lot of moles and I've been watching them for any changes.  At first it was just the one, now he has three more and another one starting.  It's a complete lack of pigment, all circular, no irregular shapes, they don't hurt and the largest isn't changing.  It's all in an area where he just got a tatoo?  Could that have something to do with it?  I'm just concerned because more are forming and fairly rapidly.  Any answers would be helpful.  Thank you so much.","Symptoms of Skin Cancer: Skin cancer can look many different ways. The most common sign of skin cancer is a change on the skin, such as a growth or a sore that won't heal. Sometimes there may be a small lump. This lump can be smooth, shiny and waxy looking, or it can be red or reddish brown. Skin cancer may also appear as a flat red spot that is rough or scaly. Not all changes in your skin are cancer, but you should see your doctor if you notice changes in your skin. Melanoma can form from or near a mole, so it is important to have your health care provider check unusual (atypical) moles that are larger than others, have different colors, or that have irregular edges (borders). The American Academy of Dermatology says that if you notice a mole on your skin, look for the simple ""ABCD"" warning signs of melanoma: 

Asymmetry ï¿½ one half does not match the other half. 

Border irregularity ï¿½ the edges are ragged, notched or blurred. 

Color ï¿½ the pigmentation is not uniform. Shades of tan, brown or black are present, causing a mottled, or splotchy, appearance. Dashes of red, white, and blue add to the mottled appearance. 

Diameter ï¿½ the width is greater than six millimeters (about the size of a pencil eraser). Any growth of a mole should be of concern. 

Malignant melanoma usually begins as a mottled, light brown to black flat blemish with irregular edges and is at least one-quarter inch in size. It can turn red, blue or white, or bleed and crust on the surface. 

A skin growth called actinic keratoses (AKs) can be the earliest sign of squamous cell carcinoma. AKs are small, scaly spots that form on body parts that have been exposed to the sun. They may start as small, red, flat spots then grow larger and become scaly or thick, like a wart. Most AKs form on the face or back of the hands

Thanks!","definetly call an allergy specialist now and book an appointment-and make sure you insist that it's soon, preferably today while you have the rash so you can show it to them as it's happening.  they can run tests and give you medication-maybe something besides benadryl-and you will know what is going on.  the fact that you had an allergy two days in a row of this sort suggests to me that your immune system is changing, so it'd help to get a doctor's opinion to minimize the risk of a third attack anytime soon.  you could be allergic to something you are eating..you could be allergic to the weed killer-those things tend to be airbourne, right?  so it wouldn't necessarily mean you have to be ON the field, merely being near it could trigger an attack.  you could also being having exercise-induced allergies, which is where people sometimes get rashes all over after doing anything physical like running, jogging, doing sports etc.  allergies are sneaky and hard to decode, that's why you need to get a professional's thoughts on the matter.  think of it this way-the sooner you act, the sooner you have answers and take it all under control.  you poor thing-i hope you feel better soon.  thoughts are with you.  good luck!",allergic reaction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I am, however, still wondering what is happening to me.",allergic reaction,,,,,,,,,"Am I allergic to the weed killer, or a bug bite I got or something?

44,94970,Elbow injury?,"Two months ago, I hit my elbow pretty badly on a hard surface and it gave me a sudden pain straight down my whole hand. You know, the kind where it gives you the electric feel.

A few hours later, my elbow still felt some pain. 
There's no bruises whatsoever.
When I touched it, I felt as if there is some thing in my elbow that's moving a bit. And it felt a bit pain.

Two months later (which is now), I could still feel this ""moving object"" in my elbow. And I felt some pain whenever it hit any hard surface (even lightly).  
And there's no bruises at all.

48,349030,Do I have asthma?,"On occasion, since I was about 15 or 16 (I'm now 30), under certain circumstances, I will have tightness in my chest, wheezing, etc. It has always been after exertion. But it's been exertion with one of the following...
a) cold- usually around 40 degrees F or colder...
b) dust- wind has kicked up a lot of dust...
c) pollen- there's been a high pollen count (I do have spring-time allergies, so I'm not sure if this is another symptom if the hayfever.)

The tightness under my sternum has always taken many hours to go away- 8-10 hours, sometimes overnight. Occasionally, it will be a little less if I can shower right away and rinse off the dust or pollen.","Firstly, Asthma - The Symptoms are, coughing often at night, wheezing, a tight feeling in the chest and shortness of breath are common. Some people may have mild symptoms,while others have severe symptoms resulting in treatment in hospital.                                   Symptoms tend to be worse at night, and first thing in the morning.
       
                Asthma has become more common in the last 20yrs. In the Uk, more than 5 million people - about 1 in 7 children and 1 in 13 adults are believed to have it.

                 Asthma can run in famlies, and is more likely to develop if someone already has Eczema or Hay Fever. 

                  Excercise is good for Asthma, and sufferers should lead a normal. The risk is reduced by not smoking. Hous dust mite dung, pet hairs, smog and stress, also coughs and colds are triggers.

                    If you feel any of these are your symptoms, you should see a Dr. He or she would do a peak flow test, and then recommend any medication you would need, they may also suggest an allergie test.",asthma,25-34 years old,,,,,,,"I will have tightness in my chest, wheezing, etc.","tightness in my chest, wheezing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Do I have asthma?,,,,,,No,,,

My question is, will these headaches and my sleeping get better over the next few weeks??  Thank you!","This is best answered by the doctor that prescribed this medication for you.  However, I was on Zoloft for a period of time.  With anti-depressants it takes approximately 4-6 weeks to see the full effects on your mental health.  It usually, like any drug you take, affects your body in a negative way for a short period of time (i.e. side effects).  This time depends on your body and the way it reacts.  For me, my body was used to it after the first week or so.  So I would recommend waiting 2 weeks then possibly calling your doctor regarding your side effects.

Oh, and the comment above about it taking 3-4 months to go away is completely incorrect.  Again, it depends on your body, but for the normal individual side effects from drugs usually disappear within 1 to 2 weeks (at most) of discontinuing the drug.",Zoloft,,,,,,,,,,The first week was horrible (expecially because I'm  in the service) I felt like I was on some crazy bad drugs in my own little world,Zoloft,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"My question is, will these headaches and my sleeping get better over the next few weeks?",,,,,,No,,,
51,894753,Dr. Sam: HELP!! (for real this time...I can honestly say that I'm scared out of my mind)?,"I got a few crowns about four months ago and since then the gums directly above them have been tender and dark.  I got braces about a month after this.  Everything was fine until about three weeks ago when the gumline just above the crowns became inflamed.  I went to the dentist because i thought I had gingivitis but he said according to the x-rays everything looked fine.  He thinks I may have a small gap or hole between the crown and my gum.  I was given a prescription for pain relievers and antibiotics even though he said they won't do much.  He said that the periodontist may have to cut parts of my gum out and my gums might inflamed due to plaque getting trapped in my gums.  He said that I may have to get the crowns redone. 
Do you think this is something to be dealt with asap or can it wait a month?  What do you think is happening and what might happen if I do nothing but brush three times a day, floss daily, use Crest Pro-Health Rinse daily and use a flouride rinse daily?","I'm here, but a little busy lately...

Again and as always, please remember that I have not seen you or your x-rays and I am just speculating so that you might have a better understanding of what questions to ask the person who is actually treating you.

My first impression is that you should not immediately notice a change in your gums when you get crowns.  Maybe for a day or three, they will be irritated after having the cement cleaned away and so on, but they really should return to pretty much normal within a few days.  This suggests to me that the edge of the crowns (the ""margins"") might not be technically the best possible, because this alone will canuse gum irritation.  I can't see or judge your crowns, but that is a red flag for me.

If you want to wait a month, that is up to you.  Again, I just can't see your gums, can I?  Unless you have something really horrible going on, a month will not usually make THAT much difference.  I am guessing that you want to wait until January 1 for a new insurance year.  Go ahead with the antibiotics for now and see what happens in the next couple of weeks.  Things don't generally move so fast that they are irreversible with minor gum irritations.

I would suggest that you see the periodontist and try to read between the lines and get his/her comments on how the crowns fir your teeth.  Since your dentist refers patients to this periodontist who relies on referrals for a living, you may not get a direct answer, but he/she won't tell a boldfaced lie,either.

In the meantime, you are right.  Just step up your home care to as nearly perfect as you can possibly manage.",gums,,,,,,,,He said that the periodontist may have to cut parts of my gum out and my gums might inflamed due to plaque getting trapped in my gums.,gum,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Do you think this is something to be dealt with asap or can it wait a month?,,,,,,No,,,

They will have much more knowledge about treating your trich and polyps than your GP or OBGYN because that is all they focus on.

Zenmed has no side effects and it's non-irritant to the

results! It's certainly a good lotion to prevent further

Another product that I think is effective is Atopalm. This dry skin mlm is one of the best seller at skinstore.com now. (Skinstore.com holds more than 10,000 skin care products) It's pretty effective, and worth the dollar paid out.

67,3111665,Should I undergo rotator cuff surgery?,"I am a 56 year old man, on disability for back and neck problems. I take care of my 87-year old father.

I have torn the rotator cuffs of both my shoulders and a surgeon says , after an MRI, that I need surgeries--two of them, left first, right later.

Right now, I am mildly inhibited only. I can still bathe, dress, and do basic household tasks. I even pull the start cord for my dad to mow the lawn.

But I cannot push even pillows or clothing up onto a shelf above my head in the closet. And I have mild difficulty in putting clothes out to dry on a clothesline.

I know that all surgery is risky.
I am a recoering alcoholic, too, so I hesitate to go under general 
anesthesia. I also hesitate to have to wear slings or cats on my arms for weeks or months, temporarily becoming more ""disabled"".

What do you think? If you are an M.D., great, please respond. Or, if you have had this type of surgery and wish to report your results with it, I'd like to hear from you. 
No abuse!!","funny you should ask...i just had arthoscopic surgery done last friday...in much the same way that they would do the rotator cuff...mine was dislocated and they fixed the cartilidge to prevent it from happening again...

it's a big decission - but not that the surgery is over, i'm so glad i did it...

i was in much of the same situation as you were...limited mobility....above my head...but, was still healing from the dislocation...

i have minimal pain - and today being 4 days after, haven't takenthe pain meds at all...my mobility is pretty good...i do have a sling, and will have to do some physical therapy in a week or so, but the doc tells me that after that my mobility should be back to almost normal.....

sling is only going to be on for about 10-14 days...

i work as a counselor for people in 12-step programs - i'm assuming that your fear is for the drugs afterwards?  i;m sure if you spoke with the surgeon he could figure something out...don't use it as an excuse.....

anyway...not sure if i helped or not...in my opinion the surgery isn't as bad as i expected it to be....and only 4 days later it is already feeling ok...

i'm only 32 and didn't want to feel disabled the rest of my life - reaching the top shelf...washing my hair, etc...

72,3702681,Help me understand how families deal with cancer -  family has no extended family?,"ok this is kinda long, but I'm so confused -- my fiance' got diagnosed with stage 3 vocal chord cancer in August (he's 35 and was in air force)-- since then it's like his family has almost turned on me, his dad said some of the meanest thing at the beginning of his treatment , like told me to stay away since I'm not a part of the family, and moved his in with them (which is totally understand since his mother doesn't work and could watch him the whole time) But I don't understand it--- do some families just deal with crisis by shutting everyone else out and isolating the person sick?  My fiance and I have been together and lived to gether over a year - but being told not to come around hurt-- and now that his treatments are over he's different, and his family is still 'weird' if that makes sense... I don't know what to do about--- My fiance tells me to be patient a little longer< that he feels secure in our relationship, but then he stands me up Thanksgiving with his family","I work in a chemo ward, and I see the things that families do to each other when one of them is diagnosed with cancer;
I have seen partners shut out and isolated, I have seen people at each other's throats; everyone wants to be close to the patient; everyone wants to protect him.
Your fiancee has been through a life changing event. He looks at life differently now. It must be very hard for you to be sidelined like this. How cruel of his family to shut you out at this time; this doesn't bode well for your future married life together.
Write to his family; say you would like the opportunity to clear the air - that you love him very much, and that you want to be part of his life - the bad bits as well as the good bits. Try not to allocate blame; and try not to be self pitying when you speak to them.
It sounds like your fiancee made his decision when he moved back in with them; I wonder why he felt he had to do that? For the moment, you may have to take his word that things are ok between you.
I would think that things are not ok.
You are supposed to be his bride-to-be; you are on the verge of married life together. I wonder about his level of committment to you if he ran home when trouble raised it's head.
Sorry to be a devil's advocate here, but I would not be happy with that situation at all.
Treatment does change people; families often close ranks against those whom they consider to be ""outsiders"". Still, I think they are being unesscessarily cruel here. Was there some conflict between you and them before his illness?Do they not approve of you for some reason?
It was a truly horrible and unchristian thing to do, to leave you out of Thanksgiving. It should be a time of rejoicing and reconcilation; and why did he not insist on you being invited?
Having cancer does not mean you turn into a little boy again.
I'm very sorry for you, that is awful. You are suffering too, worrying about him and your future.
I think you are entitled to some answers from him; a long talk between you both should be arranged. you are a part of his life, he should affirm that in some way, and if he does not, I would seriously wonder whether you should continue to wait for him.

89,395547,About Human Growth Hormone and Anti Aging and LAZY Pituitary syndrome.?,"I am wondering if one gets to use H.G.H for a long time(say a year or so at least)if that would make the indigeneous secretion of H.G.H by the Pituitary decrease and when and if you stop using the medication if the bodys own secretion will not pick up again (called LAZY PITUITARY SYNDROME) and you will then age even faster than you would have in the first place.Any professional colleagues with an insite into this predicament, as I have not been able to find a definite answer anywhere!","Your best answer to this is how old someone is.

Teens and up to 25yr olds produce enough from the pituitary gland. It's only as we age pass this, does production slow down. It does'nt stop though - people who work out hard and regular show increased levels in comparison to others. 

There is no evidence to date that if you supplement, then stop - your natural production will decrease further because of the 'un-natural' supplementation.

We looked into this with the rave drug 'xtasy' (MDA) and the release of serotonin - once again, the neurotransmitters regulated themselves. This was only one study though.

This could be because there are few sucesses, which I doubt, since I've found ECT has an 80% sucess rate, or because people would generally rather speak of cautionary tales. I'd love to hear personal experiences from people who have had ECT treatments, and overall whether or not they would recommend it to others.","My father has been undergoing ECT treatment for bipolar disorder for the last 8 weeks and it has not been working for him.  He says it is better than nothing but not nearly as good as the medication (lithium).  He started ECT because he ended up with toxic levels of lithium in his system for a while that gave him cognitive impairment.  It is hard to say if the ECT is keeping the cognitive impairment going or stopping it where it is.  Overall, the treatments are OK and he hasn't experienced any memory loss.

the people seemed happier and more relaxed on a whole too,,ironically

then i came back home and after a few months I went back into a bad depression

I, too, doubt it would be cancer, but I must strongly disagree that ""you would know if you had skin cancer"". That's simply not true, and it's the reason why so many people aren't diagnosed until it's too late.

If it's prickly heat, in an adult it's usually nothing to worry about and will go away - though the thing that makes me doubt this diagnosis is that it doesn't bother you at all. Prickly heat is often quite irritating, but then, everyone's different.

The allergen is either something she is exposed to externally or something she is getting from your breastmilk or from the infant formula your using. try changing formulas if your using them. If breastmilk, then you must start the process of elimination and see what makes a difference when you exclude it from your diet. A good indicator can be some thing you eat that unsettles her after feeding time. Possibly find out from a Naturopath what foods you are sensitive to and eliminate those from your diet also as they can pass through as well. Try changing the covers and clothes you use to natural fabrics as well.
Antihistamines are not great for infants and are a last resort. Try some Calendular Ointment, this will sooth the rash as will bathing with Chamomile Tea. See this website http://www.carolineskincare.com.au this is a wonderful natural product that can help as well, I have used it a lot in my clinic and on my own kids. These are only topical (external)treatments, the underlying allergen (cause) needs to be found and gotten rid of so please do not think that it has cleared when the rash dies down a bit.
It is also possible she has Psoriasis which is also aggravated by allergies and heat.

Congratulations on sticking with the AA program. You are doing a great job and I hope you stick with it. You have made another positive step forward by putting yourself out on Answers.

I am not an alcoholic, but several of my friends are and I have done everything possible to support them, so, I hope that I have some advice/insight that benefits you.

First and foremost, ask your fellow AA members, as well as AA management, about any doctors they would specifically recommend who are sensitive to the needs of recovering alcoholics/addicts.

You are right: recovering alcoholics face some specific health concerns best dealt with by a doctor who understands.

Diabetes, liver disease, digestive problems, cardiac, hepatitis, ocular disease, and immune system problems are all side effects of alcoholism.

This website below is a special AA website for doctors who are also recovering alcoholics:
http://www.idaa.org/
Contact them. They will be able to provide you with doctors sensitive to your needs.

The original AA founder's home:
http://www.drbobshome.org/index.html
Send them an email explaining your situation. They will find a way to provide information to you.

I would start off with these two sites and build from there. With time spent researching your concerns, you will discover a lot more information.

Keep on doing what you are doing: asking questions, being strong, reminding yourself what is really important, and your willingness to want to help others is very inspiring.

I think you will be very successful with continuing to control your alcoholism and your desire to help others is the most powerful medicine of all for you.

God's love and peace be with you.",long term alcohol or drug abuse,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A lot of my friends and myself go to  doctors but when we tell a doctor we have been addicts, they don't seem to hear anything beyond that.",addicts,,,,,,,,,Anyone that would just like to tell me their experiences please do.,,Yes: Congratulations on sticking with the AA program.

6,3599096,Is it possible to have a strong mind and a weak body?,"I am a very found person. Smart, intellectual, goal oriented, great personality and good social life. However, I suffer from anxiety and panic disorder.  I posses the ability to control my thoughts and be critical in conflictive situations, however,  my body reacts. I can't controll my body reactions. If I didn't have a body I would be a happy but of course that is impossible. Is it because of a chemical unbalance? Is it that my mind is not strong enough to be able to control my body? How can I make my body stop reacting to my critical tought? By the way, I am the type of person who in an argument will never explode and will try to be critial and tolerant, though, sometime I feel that my body feels like exploding, not my mind? Should I explode and don't care, but then again if I do that I'll be betraying my mind. See the dilemma? I need to stop this anxiety!!","You put yourself under a lot of pressure. you seem to be a perfectionist and the husband every mother wishes for her daughter. The problem is that you forget about your needs and your feelings. You cannot put yourself second all the time. Sometimes you have to say no or say something that might offend others. The world today is built like that, unfortunately. Sometimes, you just cannot control everything and your body is your best example. you should analyze what kind of situations cause those panic attacks or anxiety attacks. Is there anything specific that causes it? Do those situations have something in common? Are those situations which are out of your control? Maybe you should let go and not try to control yourself. I don't mean that you should change the way you are as you seem to be a very caring person and heavens knows there aren't enough of your kind. What I mean is that you may need to follow your instinct more than your mind. i strongly believe that instincts are made to protect us from danger. Open yourself up to it.

7,4255782,My migraines have went from bad to worse. Can anyone PLEASE HELP me?,"I'm 25 and started having migraines at the age 9.  In the last 3mos, they have been different,  I have lost my sight once with one, and I now stutter or am unable to speak the words I want to when I have a migraine. Then to top it off I am now having siezers. And my hands shake even when I don't have a migraine. I had an EEG but there was nothing. I have been under stess.(trying to buy a new house, fight with the inlaws, and kids) I really thought I was ok with all of this. I started depakote on may 2nd. and yet still all this is happening I am now up to 500mg twice a day. Can anyone think of anything that might help. I'm tired of the feeling that people think it's all in my head. PLEASE HELP","I'm a nurse practioner who treats only women so I see TONS of women suffering with stess reactions and migranes. If you are having true siezures where you pass out and have the classic jerking movements,you should have an MRI of your brain to be certain that there isn't anything such as a tumor causing these new symptoms. An MRI is a special imaging test that can actually see these lobes of the brain,blood vessels and bony structures,kind of like an Xray but able to see things the Xray can't. Your shaking hands sound more like anxiety and or panic. A panic attack can feel like you're having a heart attack and a few people will actually pass out or have odd movements that can be misdiagnosed as a siezure. The migranes can often be controlled or at least made more manageable with daily medication. I'd suggest you talk to your health care provider and ask to be put on something like Lexipro or Paxil. These are both antidepressants but are also excellent for dealing with stress and anxiety and can also decrease the frequency and severity of the headaches.If you notice that your headaches are the worst on your period or about halfway between them and you're not on birth control pill somtiimes taking the pill to even out the hormone  levels can be helpful.I often use a drug called Verapamil taken daily to try and prevent you from having as many headaches.It's a blood pressure med but acts to prevent some of the changes in the brain that cause the migrane pain. I'm a migrane sufferer too and last year mine got ugly but since I started Verapamil in August I haven't had one at all . I've had the aura several times but the pain never came. I was surprised that it worked this well.Usually, it makes things more managable at least.There are other thing that can help such as feverfew supplement, magnesium or a B vitamin called riboflavin. These need to be taken daily and take a while to become effective. Don't give up till you get some relief. Your best bet is to find someone who specializes in women's issues or a headache specialist if none of the usual things work. I know this is a long answer but it's a complicated problem. There!

Can You give me some advice please that would be greatly appreciated!!,"It sounds unfair. But being part of a family is about coming together as unit and working towards all of your happiness and prosperity. If you parents have to work and can't be provided with a care worker to watch you brother then I guess they have no choice.
I must be very difficult to have a brother with these syndromes and I have alot of respect for you for looking after your brother...its not a task any of your family asked for and I'm sure you love him very much.
Its sounds like you should  sit down and talk calmly to your parents about this when they are not busy themselves(ie not stressed). You need to be objective and explain that it is too much for you as a 15year to be looking after your brother all this time, you have your own life too. Would it be possible to get a care worker that could come and watch your brother when they work. Or could you come to a compromise where you look after him less and someone else watches him(care worker/sibling/family member) at other times.
I'm from the UK, so US may be different but in the UK your family would be entitled to a full-time care worker for free. Maybe your family are entitled to something similar.

With this you need to make your parents clear on what he does and how it makes you feel(does it distress you?). Further I think that you a should keep in mind the Police have a duty to come round if you feel unsafe or he is going to far. Nothing bad will happen to your brother they will just calm him down and restrain him(reasonably). He won't go to jail as they will understand his symptoms.

It sounds like your daughter still has a hard life and hasn't gotten her disorder under control, and this has affected her children. It is possible to control this disorder, though, but it cannot be cured. Help your grandson by getting him in treatment and being as supportive as possible. Hopefully if it is started early and you are there to help him, he can gain conrol of his life and control the disorder instead of letting it control him.

I had gotten a lot of info from the American Cancer Society.  Try this link: http://www.cancer.org/docroot/home/index.asp.  There is info there about trials and treatments.  On certain patients (not my dad) they can do chemo.  In Multiple Myeloma the symptoms can be treated, but there is no cure.  My dad received steroid treatment.  He had gotten radiation to a couple of really painful areas and it seemed to help him a lot.  Also he got blood transfusions when his blood count was off and that helped too.  He did end up going on dialysis because as the cancer eats the bone, calcium is released into the system and the kidneys can't handle too much calcium.  Sometimes patients receive stem cell transplants. Good luck to the patient & family.

19,238160,Help! How do  I get my 6 yr old son to pay attention in school?,"My son is 6, almost 7 and he has developmental delays. He was never classified as autistic or having PDD, all we were ever told was he has a speech delay. My husband, inlaws, myself and his teacher and speech therapist are concerned with his inability to pay attention. He daydreams and ""plays"" video games in class (moves his hands and fingers like he's holding a controller). The teacher hasn't said it but I think she's thinking ADD or something similar. I've talked to friends with kids similar ages and they all say their kids do the same thing so I know part of it is just my son being a normal 6 year old. The problem he faces is when he drifts he risks getting lost and not being able to grasp what the rest of the class is working on. How can I teach him to stay focused on the task at hand and how to bring himself back when he does drift? Are there games we can play with him? He does watch too much tv, and I know I need to do something about that.","Honestly, you seem to have a pretty rough idea of what you need to do. Just stick with what you are doing and cut the cable off, and maybe take away the games. Just for a few months and see if he improves at school.

Yes, you are right. You do have a normal six year old boy. You could also try using some other sort of methods to increase his attention span.

1) TV Time Needs To Be Trimmed - A child's attention span only lasts about 8 to 10 minutes. Funny that 8 to 10 minutes is how long a television program is on for until it breaks for commercial.

2) Games and Gadgets - When it comes to game systems, just remove them from the picture. Two ways to do so, A) Take them from him while he is either using them or is around or B) Move them into a place where only you know the whereabouts when he is at school.

Some might also suggest using educational games to help but I have found that t defeats the purpose of taking away games all together. Besides, he needs to learn to stay focused and not get better hand eye coordination. Maybe to hone some math or english skills, but not for what you're dealing with right now.

I hope I could be of some help to you.",Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,,,,,,,,The teacher hasn't said it but I think she's thinking ADD or something similar.,ADD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,How can I teach him to stay focused on the task at hand and how to bring himself back when he does drift?,,No,,,
20,1320005,eating disorders?,"this might sound like an odd/stupid question, but how do you know when you really have an eating disorder?...im only asking this because my parents think i have an eating disorder but im not, according to them im in 'denial' but i do eat...but i do admit when i was younger (in elementary school) i tend to have eaten a bit more than now...but it isnt like im straving myself i do eat when im hungry...how can i tell my parents im perfectly fine and i dont have an eating problem!!
thanxs to anyone who responds...
much love; caroline <3 xoxox","Caroline, you sound like a real sweetie :) The way you can tell if you have an eating disorder is if you find yourself constantly obsessing with calories and with your weight. 
If you eat , but you in eat in very small amounts, if you find yourself purging (eating and then vomiting or taking laxatives) ANother thing is if you avoid certain foods because you are constantly afraid of fat intake. For example you are afraid of eating a hamburger because you think it will make you fat. 

People that have eating disorders are constantly afraid of getting fat, they are constantly obesessing with calories, they eat very little, they only eat certain foods For example, some lady on here was telling us that she ate nothing but cantelope and drank water and could not figure out why she wasn't losing weight. Basically you have a fear of eating because you don't want to get fat

When I was a kid, I went through a phase of not eating breakfast. I just didn't want to, I would get up and I wasn't hungry, but I had to  learn to eat it because if I didn't I would get terrible stomachaches. When I was 14 I just completely lost my appetite and I was getting terribly skinny and it worried my mom so she was giving me my favorite foods to help me regain my appetite. 

YOu didn't ask an odd or stupid question. Maybe ...you should suggest that your parents and you go to counseling so that you can get this resolved or maybe you should suggest that they get some information on eating disorders. I know that it must be frustrating for you. They are just concerned parents. Maybe a little counseling will help you guys or maybe learning about the true facts together. 

They just may be overly concerned feeling that you should eat more or something. I don't know

24,3210137,Swollen foot?,"Ok, this is a very odd situation so let me explain:
I am in my late 20's, and my right foot has been slightly swollen for about 8 years now.  At first I didn't get it checked out because I was in school and couldn't afford health insurance (don't you love our country's priorities?).  Over the last couple of years I have been to several different types of doctors and noone seems to know what is wrong.  Here are some of the things I've heard:
My regular dr did blood work and bone scan....nothing.
A podiatrist did an x-ray....nothing.
A vascular surgeon examined it and said it maybe Venus [something] syndrom where the valves in my leg don't let the blood through...but he wasn't sure.
I had my legs scanned by a sonagram technichian and she said there is a thickening of the outer vein in both legs that was maybe caused by a previous blood clot...but wasn't sure.  She said I didn't have to worry about blood clots (of course I asked).
I have never had any pain or discolorization. ideas?","Because it is one leg only it seems to relate to the energy flow on the affected side.  Think of any possible cause of this condition. Check your posture in the mirror--are you favouring one leg? In school this can happen easily when one carries heavy knapsacks on one shoulder. Emotionally the right side of our body relates to the male energy.  What issue can you connect with the swelling , what happened in your life around the time the swelling started? There is a reason for everything. It might sound silly but ask your body for a cause and for a remedy before you go to sleep.  Expect an answer to come and it will soon. Good luck!
In addition, there a few things you can do to improve blood circulation in your feet;
Please change the type of socks you wear--Pure cotton, or pure wool are best, no elastic and  no nylon. Also try to elevate the foot above the heart level several times a day. Make sure you do not cross your feet while sitting or lying in bed.  Drink, preferably boiled water at room temperature, often enough to keep your pee colourless and free of smell.  Reduce yeast in your diet. Make sure your nostrils are free and allow for an equal air supply--close one nostril and inhale deeply then exhale, in a few times, then out a few times. Repeat with other nostril. try leg stretches at least twice a day.  Every bit helps.  Expect your body to find a way to correct the condition soon.

You do sound like you may have some depression and/or anxiety issues. The good thing is that you have already started the road to recovery by reaching out for help. Both depression and anxiety are very curable. I have had both of these, and counseling really helped me. 

Please know that when you are feeling like this is part of being down, and that things can get better. Your fears of not being good enough are very common to people who are depressed and people in general! I don't think there are many people who have not privately felt that they are not ""good enough"".  Self confidence can be learned. In the meantime, be gentle to yourself - you deserve it. 

You sound like you could benefit from going to counseling. There are many ways to do this. You can get a referral from a community information center or 211 if there is a 211 line in your area. If you do not have benefits at work, there are some non-profit agencies if money is an issue. Some faith communities have trained counselors as well.  If you have a good relationship with your family doctor, you could also talk to them about this and see if they have some referrals.

31,4081162,Newborn anxiety?,"So here is my story.... after 3 years of marriage and much discussion and planning, my husband and I decided to have a baby. Took all of one try (no kidding). Everything was fine up until week 24, I started having contractions and am now bed bound until our daughter arrives. So here I am, almost 29 weeks pregnant and attempting to register for my shower, and I just realized something. Our baby is going to be born, we are going to get her home.... and then what? I am chalking it up to hormones and the fact that this is our first baby, but just realized I am scared to death! Hubby has never really been around babies, the only experience I have is babysitting 10 years ago. I already love my daughter, I have loved her from the first day I found out I was pregnant... I don't want to screw her up! Please tell me some of you brand new parents have been through this!","Oh!  CONGRATULATIONS on your pregnancy.  I'm sorry to hear that you are on bedrest but I'm glad to hear you are taking care of yourself and doing what you need to do to finish baking her and bring her in safe and sound.

I was 31 when I had my first baby and 35 when I just had my third one.  So I was a bit older.  I had done a TON of babysitting in my younger days and my sister and I are 8 years apart and I did lots and lots of care for her when she was born and afterwards!

But yet..I was still completely terrified when it was my own baby.  Now *I* was responsible for raising this child and *I* was responsible for how it turns out as an adult.  HOW SCARY IS THIS????

But you know what?  I have to live and learn..make my mistakes..and move on.  And you will too.  

You might not be able to because of your bed rest but I recommend taking a child birth class.  If you can't do that then a Newborn basics class is pretty helpful.  It will teach you how to put on a diaper, bathe the baby, infant CPR, how to swaddle a baby (KEY if you want them to sleep better)--how often they need to be fed..just basic things for a happy, healthy, baby.

Even though the newborn stage is so difficult becuase of the lack of sleep..guess what?  That is the easy part!  It gets harder when they get older and then you have to start using redirection and discipline.  Then you really start questioning your parenting abilities!

So enjoy the newborn stage.  It goes REALLY REALLY REALLY fast.  

You really will be okay.  You are already ahead of the game!  You have your husband's support AND you already love your baby.  You will do just fine!

If you really want more input from others though--you can continue to do what you are already doing..research on the Internet.

There are great sites out there that helped me get through all three of my pregnancies.  Just knowing there are others out there who we can direct our questions to or just get moral support (newborns are HARD work!)is AWESOME!  There's two sites in particular that I will list below.  You can join the Birth club for the date that your baby is due and then you are all be pregnant at the same time and you can get to know these people over the span of the pregnancy and you can hear the birth stories of the people who are due ahead of you and then you can continue to network with these people and ask questions and get advice as the babies grow!  It also sends you week-by-week updates on what is happening with your baby during the pregnancy adn then what is hpapenign with the baby's develpoment once she's been born.  It's great.  

In addition to Internet resouces--Doctors are good resouces.  Some sites on the Internet are good resouces.  Other Mommies are good resources.  Your own Mom is a good resource (if she's still in your life).  You will be okay.

I am pregnant 20 weeks I'm 19 years old and have depression and type 1 diabetes the father of my baby i was with for 3 years and he physical and emtionally abused me for the hole time. We have been in and out of court since last year for the fact that he physically assulted me and threanted my younger sister.

He on purpose i may add got me pregnant and than turned around and said he wants nothing to do with his child. I now have to do it with the support of my family and good friends. He may have hung up on you beucase he was shocked. The first thing you need to do is take a test you may b worrying about nothing if he abmondeds you than so be it. You don't need him!! although ur 17 and ur folks will b suprised im sure they will be there for you.

I was so focused on finding a father for them that I went from relationship to relationship and now they have a lot of bad feelings because I put them through it too.  Also, go to college.  There are MANY places that will help a single mother. They will even pay for your childcare while you go to school Take advantage them.  You just can't raise a child anymore on $5.00 or 6.00/hr.  That way you wont have to depend on anyone else. When have a degree and a good job then the right person will come along and you will be so secure that you wont have to depend on him.  I commend you on leaving your abuse relationship.  Remember God loves you and you deserve to be treated with respect and love.  If a man hits you one time, it is one time too many.

36,1045175,What is Oxalic Acid and why does Joe Hart call it God's chemotherapy?,"Colonel Joe Hart of http://www.coljoe.com contends that Oxalic acid in your immune system will cure everything from virus, bacteria, and fungi infections within our bodies.  He writes that  by maximizing and keeping in balance the Oxalic acid in our bodies, we can maintain an immune system capable at keeping all forms of cancer out of our bodies, as well as shrink existing cancers now present in your body.  He list a number of baddies, called blockers which will and can totally drain the Oxalic Acid out of our bodies in less than an hour, and suggest that we totally avoid these blockers at all cost but particularly if you are sick with any malady. Ever hear of this before on any topic of discussion concerning this chemical substance? The chemical based compound which is imported into this country is used primarily as an ethching agent to clean things such as radiators. But the Oxalic Acid Col. joe is refering to occurs and is found in our diet, primarily dark leafy veggies.","Whatever Colonel Joe calls Oxalic Acid may or may not be what Wikapedia calls Oxalic Acid. I listened to Col Joe on a radio show and he claimed that fresh juiced carrot was the best source of oxalic acid. Carrot Juice may contain trace amounts of oaxalic acid but there is a lot more going on with carrots that makes it a wonderful juice when added to one's daily diet.

As far as Colonel Joe's stand on Vitamin C, I can see how it relates to Oaxalic Acid but I couldn't disagree more about Vitamin C's health benefits. Vitamin C is a first rate healing vitamin as proven by hundreds of double blind placebo controlled studies.

As far Vitamin B-6 goes, I believe there needs to be a balance of B-Vitamins if B Vitamins are being used as a supplement

In any case, I believe Colonel Joe has had great success from helping hundreds of chronically ill people looking for a way to overcome Cancer and other deadly diseases. There are many directions to the same place and perhaps Colonel Joe's healing modality works just fine. There are many good things on Colonel Joe's list of good things to eat. If you get enough of those good foods then you might not need those foods with Vitamin C and B-6.

AUTISM, AUTISTIC, ADHD, ADD, Coma Brain Damage, Special Autistic Kids Treatment Cure By our Master Tole .
 

These Autism , Epilepsy, coma, brain damage etc has been on our research and treatment top list from 1984 .  



Master Tole practices the complete Ancient Chinese Way of THE TOLE'S WAY OF MEDICATIONS in the modern Autism Treatment Cure -since 1984 for Autism.  
Each Autistic kids are not the same, different in a few or more conditions and also recovery condition , also lever and rate of recovery.  



(8)Autistic Kids.
1. Autistic Kids Disorder 
Autistic Kids symptoms:

(A) total of six (or more) items from (1), (2), and (3), 
with at least two from (1),
and one each from (2) and (3): 


1. Autism Autistic Kids qualitative impairment in social interaction, as manifested by at least two of the following: 
(a) Impairment in the use of multiple non-verbal behaviors such as eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression, body postures, and gestures to regulate social interaction 
(b) failure to developed relationships appropriate to developmental level 
(c) a lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or achievements with other people (e.g., by a lack of showing, bringing, or pointing out objects of interest) 
(d) lack of social or emotional response


2. Autism qualitative impairments in communication as manifested by at least one of the following: 
(a) delay in, or total lack of, the development of spoken language (not accompanied by an attempt to compensate through alternative modes of communication such as gestures or mime) 
(b) without adequate speech, marked impairment by in the ability to initiate or sustain a conversation with others 
(c) repetitive use of language or words or phases
(d) lack of varied, spontaneous make-believe play or social imitative play appropriate to developmental level 


3. Autism restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities, as manifested by at least one of the following: 
(a) autism encompassing preoccupation with one or more stereotyped patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus 
(b) autism apparently inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional routines or rituals 
(c) stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms (e.g., hand or finger flapping or twisting, or complex whole-body movements or with an object) 
(d) autism persistent of liking an object, movements with sound.

(3) symbolic or imaginative play (playing or talking some form of outer space words or cartoon's words or play). 


Symptoms of Asperser's include: impaired ability to utilize social cues such as body language, irony, or other subtext of communication; restricted eye contact and socialization; limited range of encyclopedic interests; preservative, odd behaviors; didactic, verbose, monotone, droning voice; concrete thinking; over-sensitivity to certain stimuli; and unusual movements. 

All these are the symptom of autism and we have the treatment for all these problem. You have to spend enough time for the intensive treatment in order to get good result, it varies from 1 month to 6 months or more for intensive treatment (remedies, remedy).
Some of the Autistic kids that is difficult to get near to 100 % cure is that they started late on themselves more then 11 years old for some, and others are too stubborn, but we still gets major improvement about 80-90% or so until they can get easy living in their life.
We have long distance friends that",I think that this like many other things that have come and gone in the past years is unfortunatly not a cure.  People are always claiming that a diet or something is going to cure autism.  I work with children with autism and I've never heard about this working.  I know 5 years ago when they thought vaccines may be causing autism it was all over the news.  I think if it did it would be on the news and all over the place - because a cure for autism would be a big deal.  This may be a good treatment for some children but I don't think cure is the right word.

What do you think my chances are of having a downs baby?","you are just worrying....it isn't a sign. the reason you are seeing more people with DS is because they are involved more in society than in the past.  years ago when you found out your child had DS the doctors told you to institutionalize them, they wouldn't be productive members of society...well thank God that has changed!!!!  there still is a long way to go for total acceptance, but at least it is moving in the right direction. 
look at it this way....if your child did have DS would you love it any less? you probably wouldn't! you would love your child no matter what. you would be proud of the accomplishments that they have made because you know how long it took them to get there and how hard they worked to get it! it would be with immense pride that you would talk about your child to others......so it is the same whether you have a child that is deemed ""normal"" by societies standards or any other child that may happen to have a disability.",Downs Syndrome,18-24 years old,Female,,,,,,"For some reason i can't stop thinking that i might have a baby with Downs, i know this is going to sound silly but i keep seeing down's people which gets me thinking that maybe it is a sign or something.",i can't stop thinking that i might have a baby with Downs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,What do you think my chances are of having a downs baby?,,"Yes: it would be with immense pride that you would talk about your child to others......so it is the same whether you have a child that is deemed ""normal"" by societies standards or any other child that may happen to have a disability.",,,

Ever since the beginning of the new school year I have been having problems with gym class, P.E., whatever you call it. After about 10 minutes of exercise I start feeling dizzy, deoriented and I have a painful headache.

I started getting my period around the beginning of the year, same time as the problems appeared.

62,3464579,My partner with Chlamydia?,"2 years ago, my partner who is from another country I might add, went to her country at that time. She tells me via email the doctors told her she has Clamydia, I was shocked by this information. She told me to get tested, I didn't because of my anger, and I knew I had to symptoms what so ever. Then she tells me she is getting treated for it over there, her country. She comes back no problems.

Are the Doctors in that country for real, or is there something going on.

A woman not treated could face possible infertility. STD's have no nationality or borders. Regardless of where she lives, one or both of you is not practicing safe sex!

65,3319312,I seriously need HELP?,"I have an eating problem, I know that i have ben stressed out lately and I seem to be self medicating with food, most of all I dont want to admit that it is related to stress and so I just associate my eating habits with a growing appeite. So I am asking does anyone know of a diet pill that surpresses my  appeite and reduce stress level? I know there are tons of diet pills but one that specifically deal with decrese of appeite and stress. i.e last week i weighed 120lbs know Iam up to 126lbs is it normal to gain 6lbs in a week?","The diet pill will only work for a short period of time because your need to eat will overpass it because you have not dealt with your ""emotional eating"" problems.  When you have emotional eating problems, you don't eat because you are hungry, you eat because you are having to deal with an emotional problem.  So having   no appeite with the help of a diet pill means nothing to an emotional eater  because you don't eat because you are hungry.  Keep in mind the following:


 Diets can work but because we know so little about ourselves and our relationship with food, it makes it difficult to win the battle. A lot of us have problems with dieting because we have a problem called ""emotional eating"" we eat to comfort ourselves during difficult, stressful, sad, etc times in our lives.

You may experience all those emotions during dieting as we continuously get on the scale hoping to see a big difference in numbers after dieting only for a day or two. Also what is stressful when dieting is that we try to lose a large number of weight in such a short period of time which in most cases is unreasonable. 

This all brings about stress, discomfort and sadness. When we feel this way, we turn to our best friend for help and support which for many of us is food. The diet is now broken and we feel that we can't stick to diets. We then try fad diet after fad diet hoping to lose the original 20 pounds and now we may have as much as 30 pounds to lose because we continue to put on weight as we continue to break these fad diets by binging before starting our next diet. 

Please learn about your relationship with food before your next diet so that you may achieve your goals. To help a little, keep in mind the following:

You already know how to lose weight. You know that if you eat less and exercise more eventually youï¿½ll see the pounds come off. Whatï¿½s getting in your way? Why do you usually regain the weight you lost? The answer to all these questions is the same ï¿½Emotional Eating.ï¿½ Simply defined, emotional eating means you eat to satisfy emotional hunger; it means you use food for comfort or as a way to cope with life; and it means you eat for reasons other than what your body needs. Whenever you reach for a boredom-breaking snack despite your commitment, or whenever you eat to quell anxiety, thatï¿½s emotional eating. Whenever you binge after a fight, or double up on portions because your day turned sour, thatï¿½s emotional eating. Whenever you feel that sharp craving for your favorite food, thatï¿½s emotional eating. When we eat during these times while on a diet, we believe the diet doesnï¿½t work or that we lack self control and then look for the quickest way to lose weight (fasting/diet pills, ect) after eating all we can since we already messed the diet day up. Read the information below but remember that emotional eating plays a big part in why we donï¿½t continue dieting and why we regain lost weight and why we binge today and start a new diet tomorrow. Best of Luck.

P.S. After learning about my relationship with food, I was able to drop my weight from 263 pounds down to 151 pounds which is a 112 pound weight lost.",eating problem,,,,"I have an eating problem, I know that i have ben stressed out lately and I seem to be self medicating with food, most of all I dont want to admit that it is related to stress and so I just associate my eating habits with a growing appeite.",eating problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,So I am asking does anyone know of a diet pill that surpresses my  appeite and reduce stress level?

66,2028489,A question about NHS acupuncture in the UK?,"You can only get acupuncture on the NHS from a Gp that is registered as an acupuncturist.

He is 4 year. What's the pronosis? What's the best treatment possible for him? He does not make eye contact, rarely responds to people and always seems to be engrossed in his own world.","Asperger's Syndrome is a condition similar to autism, and the educational approaches work working with both are often similar. About the prognosis, I would say that it is often good, so don't despair! People with Asperger's Syndrome have won nobel prizes (Vernon Smith), become famous actors (Dan Ackroyd), or become successful computer programmers, scientists, etc.

To help your friend's child maximize his potential, I would recommend the following educational approaches. Since every child is different, these may or may not apply to your situation or work for you. I would encourage you to keep trying and find a system that works for you friend and their family. She may have already done so, but I would also recommend keeping in close contact with the child's teacher and school to make sure that he  is getting the support needed. Hope this helps! 

- Recognize your child's strengths and interests and use these as opportunities for education (for example, if your child is very interested in Star Wars, you can teach math problems about Star Wars, make cleaning up into a game about Jedi powers, etc.) You never know when an interest may turn into a possible career option for the future (I recently read a book written by a man with Asperger's who made his childhood interest in ""The Wizard of Oz"" into seveal job opportunities! [""Demystifying the Autistic Experience"" by William Stillman""]) (Source #1)

- People with autism/Asperger's are often visual learners and learn well with pictures, charts, step-by-step written instructions, etc. (Source #1)

- Consider reading books by authors with Autism/Asperger's (while these are often geared towards adults, I think they offer valuable information) Authors to consider include Temple Grandin, Edgar R. Schneider, Jerry Newport, Stephen Shore, and William Stillman (Source #1)

- I would also advise you to often require him to look at your or participate in some activity with you. Just anything so that he is engaged with you. If he does not respond, you could repeat your instruction, wait, then (if necessary) gently prompt him physically to give you a high-five by touching your hand to his or something like this. Then, when he does it, reinforce this behavior with lots of praise and perhaps a small portion of a favorite snack or something else he likes. It is importnat that he is engaged with a person or an activity (such as reading or a puzzle, etc) on a somewhat frequent basis. That being said, he also will most likely need some time where he is allowed to relax and ""be engrossed in his own world."" You may also want to develop a system where he can say one word or hand you a card with the word ""break"" written on it so that he can tell you when he is feeling overwhelmed and needs a break from the situation or activity. (Source #1)

- To motivate him to use language, you could, for example if you know he wants juice, don't just give it to him becuase you know that's what he wants. Have him say, ""juice,"" or if he is not ready for that yet, just the first sound of the word before you give him any juice. Gradually, very slowly, require him to say additional words such as, ""want juice,"" then ""want juice please,"" then ""I want juice please, etc."" before you give him the juice. Start with him requesting with one word for most of the things he wants, before starting to require sentences. (Source #1)

- ""Many children with autism are good at drawing, art and computer programming. These talent areas should be encouraged. I think there needs to be much more emphasis on developing the child's talents. Talents can be turned into skills that can be used for future employment."" (Source #2)

0,1683745,Lightheadedness again?,"My blood pressure has always been on the low normal side (98/54 one day); 106/72 another.  I thought about the BP, but since the lightheadedness remains a constant, I don't think this is the reason for it - hence the not mentioning it.  I ""feel"" that it's in my blood - sounds crazy, but true.  As for the anemia, I have normal iron levels - just a bit low RBC.  Hemocrit/Hemoglobin normal (low normal).  Another concern is my Bun & Creatinine levels rose during this blood work.  They've always been pretty constant & now they are higher than I've had, BUT AGAIN, STILL WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGES.  I've read that 1) RBC - low can cause lightheadedness, but again, docs need to get to the underlying cause of the low RBC & since I do not ""lose blood"" on a monthly basis anymore, the chances of me being iron-deficient anemic are quite low.  
2) Kidney disease can cause lightheadedness.  I really am fearful of this because Mom was diabetic & ended up with renal failure due to that.  I am NOT DIABET","Why do you think you can't be anemic just because you  are postmenopausal?  Bleeding and anemia can be caused by lots of things including slow internal bleeding.  It could be from an ulcer, esophageal erosion, it could be from the lower GI tract or all kinds of possibilities.  Since your blood levels are off some you need to talk to your doctor about this and see if he thinks this warrents further investigation or not.  As for the lightheadedness you need to see the doc and get this looked into further.  Since it is a problem for you don't rest until the doc figures out what is going on.  As for kidney diseas this is something your doc can check for.  Because your mom was diabetic you are at a little greater risk of developing it which I realize you are aware of.  Have your doc figure out what is going or get a referral to someone who can help you.

But being part of a family is about coming together as unit and working towards all of your happiness and prosperity. If you parents have to work and can't be provided with a care worker to watch you brother then I guess they have no choice.
I must be very difficult to have a brother with these syndromes and I have alot of respect for you for looking after your brother...its not a task any of your family asked for and I'm sure you love him very much.
Its sounds like you should  sit down and talk calmly to your parents about this when they are not busy themselves(ie not stressed). You need to be objective and explain that it is too much for you as a 15year to be looking after your brother all this time, you have your own life too. Would it be possible to get a care worker that could come and watch your brother when they work. Or could you come to a compromise where you look after him less and someone else watches him(care worker/sibling/family member) at other times.
I'm from the UK, so US may be different but in the UK your family would be entitled to a full-time care worker for free. Maybe your family are entitled to something similar.

One problem with an ICD is that it sometimes delivers shocks when you do not need them. Even though a shock lasts a very short time, you can usually feel it. Every shock you feel should be notified to your doctor. The settings of the ICD may need to be adjusted or your medications may need to be changed.ICD problems can sometimes be prevented by programming the device to sound an alert when there is a problem. This can be done by your electrophysiologist. If you heart your ICD alert, you should immediately call your doctor.
WARNING: In June 2005, certain ICD models and biventricular pacemaker-defibrillators were recalled by the manufacturer because of a circuitry flaw that prevents the devices from delivering therapeutic electrical shocks when needed. The problem may result in patient death. Two deaths are believed to be associated with the malfunction. Although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration did not make any specific recommendations, the agency encourages patients who may have such a device to ask their health care doctor if they should have it removed or replaced. The devices affected by this recall are:
    * PRIZM 2 DR, Model 1861, manufactured on or before April 16, 2002

I recommend, #1 see a dentist for a comprehensive exam and voice your concerns. #2 QUIT SMOKING (it increases your risk of periodontal disease). #3 Keep up with regual dental visits (often people with gum disease need to have cleanings and maintianance every 3-4 months). In most cases, someone as young as you are who practices good home care can reverse some of the loss or at least halt the disease in which case you could keep your teeth your entire life.

You do sound like you may have some depression and/or anxiety issues. The good thing is that you have already started the road to recovery by reaching out for help. Both depression and anxiety are very curable. I have had both of these, and counseling really helped me. 

Please know that when you are feeling like this is part of being down, and that things can get better. Your fears of not being good enough are very common to people who are depressed and people in general! I don't think there are many people who have not privately felt that they are not ""good enough"".  Self confidence can be learned. In the meantime, be gentle to yourself - you deserve it. 

You sound like you could benefit from going to counseling. There are many ways to do this. You can get a referral from a community information center or 211 if there is a 211 line in your area. If you do not have benefits at work, there are some non-profit agencies if money is an issue. Some faith communities have trained counselors as well.  If you have a good relationship with your family doctor, you could also talk to them about this and see if they have some referrals. I benefitted a lot from a book called Feeling Good by David Burns which should be in most major bookstores and libraries. Of course, there are many books that you might find helpful.

""Paget's Disease of the Nipple

This type of breast cancer starts in the milk ducts and spreads to the skin of the nipple and areola (the dark circle around the nipple). The nipple and areola will often appear crusted, scaly and red. The patient may experience burning, itching or notice some bloody discharge from the nipple.

Paget's Disease is a rare form of breast cancer, occurring in only 1% of all cases. It can be associated with in situ carcinoma as well as invasive carcinoma. If no lump can be felt in the breast tissue and the biopsy shows the growth to be in situ and not invasive, treatment for Paget's Disease is very effective.""

29,768616,is wearing flip flops healthy for feet or not? please see my details?,"Hi. Like most girls at 17 I love wearing flip flops all the time but many articles say they are bad for your feet. I don't get it.

The anti-flipflop articles say that b/c flip flops lack arch support your feet may get fallen arches. However many websites that encourage bare feet (which I also do a lot but only indoors) say that going barefoot can HELP strengthen your feet and develop good arches.

See the contradiction? Going barefoot and flip flops both have no arch support but barefoot can ""tone your feet"" and flip flops will ""cause fallen arches"". It makes no sense. I think flip flops is the closest you can get to natural barefoot walking without dirty feet and risk injury/infection. Can someone explain? Thanks!

Oh if you are a girl and age 15-25 please also see my bf's question: http://answers.yahoo.com/question/;_ylt=Au9U2HuU2cmoOTC_5PKlUBsjzKIX?qid=20060618235316AAv8YbX

But you are 17 years old, and your bones are already not soft and forming like a child's.  I don't think you have anything to worry about.

When this happened, I was unable to lie down, sit up or anything else. I just couldn't get comfortable. The last attack came when I ate chili for dinner.  Wow! I ended up in the emergency room and after an ultra sound, was told I was off to the operating room. My Doctor told me it wasn't life threatening, the pain was from the gall bladder having spasms when the stone was blocking the bile which put me into almost a frenzy of pain.  I had the Old surgery, this was before the laproscopic surgery was around.  I lost 26 lbs through the ordeal as well.
Later, I met a friend who also had his gallbladder removed only his was gangerous!  If he didn't have surgery right away he would have died!  So it is nothing to fool around with, if you have another attack, go to the hospital for an ultra-sound where they will determine what needs to be done....in the meantime, plenty of fluids, rest as much as you can and be very careful what you eat.  Avoid spices, eat bland until this is taken care of.  I let mine go about a year and felt so good after that I am still shaking my head as to why I didn't do it sooner!

36,107231,concerning my daughter?,"it all started when she was 2 months pregnant. the nauseas feeling, even throwing up. But there was also excruciating pain in the stomach. it got so severe that she ended up spending most of the pregnancy in the hospitals with a demerol drip. she has been to all the hospitals in the area plus some that are 50 miles away. Given all the test that the doctors can imagine. Her veins colapsed from all the needles. no one can figure out what is going on. It has been a year and a half since she delivered a healthy little girl, but the pain and vomiting still persist. Has anyone out there ever gone through this and can you tell me what is going on. Its not her pancreas, galbladder, intestines or anything that the doctors can put a finger on.   Please help, we are desparate.","First, is your daughter taking any supplements or prescription medications - especially prescription ones?  When you are taking a prescription and complain about a possible side effect, most doctors won't believe you if your complaint is not one of those listed as a potential side effect  by the drug manufacturer.  Yet as we know, each body is different.  Therefore whatever you are experiencing could be a little known side effect.  When drug companies conduct clinical trials, they often don't report findings that are less than .5% of the test population.  If you happen to be part of that .5%, however, you know that what you experienced is very real, indeed.

I recently underwent a host of tests for recurrent nausea and vomiting.  My mother asked me about medications I was taking and  immediately homed in on one of my medications as one she had been unable to take.  Nausea and vomiting were not listed as possible side effects, but on the advice of my mother and under the care of my physician, I quit taking the medicine in question.  In only three days, the problem was resolved.

If your daughter's problem cannot be tied to a medication or supplement she is ingesting, my next question would be whether or not she has seen an allergist.  Some food allergies can cause nausea and vomiting.  Of course, there are usually accompanying symptoms like edema or rash if that it the case.

A final question would be whether your daughter has been evaluated by an endocrinologist?  I had a friend whose daughter suffered for years with a similar problem before finally being diagnosed with a digestive disorder.  She now eats five small meals daily, has eliminated certain foods from her diet completely  and limits consumption of other foods to a fraction of what she used to eat.  She has been pain and nausea -free for four or five  years.

Medicine is not an exact science.  Generally, a diagnosis is reached either by determining what is NOT going on or on the assumption if X number of people experiencing what you're experiencing have Y disease, then by default that must be what you have.  

Unfortunately, not every ailment is easily diagnosed.  Furthermore, some diseases mimic other diseases so even when you get a diagnosis it can be incorrect.

I realize it is frustrating to continue seeking medical advice, but your best line of defense it to continue to seek help until someone comes up with the right diagnosis.  And if you have not seen an allergist or an endocrinologist, by all means get your daughter to consult one.  It's her body.  She must  i n s i s t  the doctors continue to evaluate her specifics until they figure out what is wrong! 

By offering your situation in this forum, it may be someone will have experienced the same thing and with the information they provide you, you will be armed for the next trip to the doctor.  You are doing all the right things by being PROactive where your daughter's health is concerned.  Hang in there because there IS an answer.  You simply have to continue to search until you find it.","pregnancy, pain and vomiting",,,,,,,,"It has been a year and a half since she delivered a healthy little girl, but the pain and vomiting still persist.",pain and vomiting still persist,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Has anyone out there ever gone through this and can you tell me what is going on.,,Yes:  You are doing all the right things by being PROactive where your daughter's health is concerned. ,,,

They can help alot with different food plans to help you.

You're not used to eating and you have to start all over like a baby.  Start with a spoon of food, soft food, maybe oatmeal, every 2 hours, and slowly work up to a larger portion.  Eat just soft foods that are easy to digest.  Your electrolyte and hormones are probably way out of sync due to malnutrition so until you are able to eat better, you may have the mood swings and all.  You need to have potassium, maybe mash up or try to eat some bananas.  The bloating is because your body is storing gases and is not used to eating.  You just need to take it slow with small bites much like a baby when they are starting to eat solids.  Drink sips of water, don't try to swig down a glass.  Try an ounce or two with each spoonful of food.  Vary it, use fruit juices too instead of just water.

So could I be pregnant or is it just pms?","If you have any of these pregnancy symptoms, and have missed your period be sure to take an at home pregnancy test, it is almost certain that you are pregnant!! 

A missed menstrual cycle can be a sign of pregnancy. It is usually the first indicator of pregnancy, although some women claim to know they are pregnant before they miss a period, since your period is not yet due, you should take the other points into consideration;

Tender swollen breasts are another early symptom. While tender breasts are a symptom of an impending menstrual cycle, swollen breasts are not. Sore and swollen breasts with a tingling sensation can be an early indicator of pregnancy;

Fatigue can be another indicator of pregnancy, especially if other symptoms are present. A nap a day can help a pregnant woman maintain normal daily activities.

It seems that you are experiencing most of these symptoms and only the missed period has not been experienced, simply because the date of your next period has not been reached.

you got yout period
and you dont experience symptoms till about 2 weeks after the egg implants itself. 

but if you didnt think you had a miscarriage then you should go tot he doc to see if anythign is left in there that could cause an infection that could lead to infertlity. but to me it just sounds like its side effects of the pill (if you are a few months new to it, your body is still adjusting, nausea, vomiting and breat tnderness are all side effects of the pill if you read the pamphlet.) never have unprotected sex either! the pill is not 100% effective and since you seem to not take them everyday then there is a decrease in effeciency of the pill protecting against pregnany. im on the pill and take it on time everyday and still use condoms even though i dont have to worry about std's cause we both lost ours to eachother, but we always use condoms just to protect against pregnancy just incase the condoms break the pill is really a back up method. 

go tot he doctor if you are still concerned. im sure you can talk tot he nurse and just get the answer over the phone but please prtect yourself! 

it is also if you are new to the pill that you bleed between periods. the symptoms of a miscarriage is heavy heavy bleeedin and severe cramps.

63,2834243,What is the best way to deal with mild to moderate depression that doesn't deal with anti-depresants(MAOI)?,"I have struggled with bouts of depression and isolation for as long as I can remember. I have seen the adverse affects of anti-depresants on my father and the way that he continued to struggle. I am a single man in my early 20's, who attends a university, and works for nearly everything he gets. I feel that there is always something missing and I;m getting tired of trying unsuccessfully to discover what it is. I have tried spirituality and I'm very active in my church but I feel unsatisfied. I have read extensively about depression and seasonal affective disorders and have come across too much information on the subject. I need the advice of you, the person reading this at this time. If you have suffered the affects of depression and have overcome without the use of perscription drugs-please tell me how you did it, or useful resourses that might help me. Thank you.","I understand your desire to stay away from ""sledgehammer"" solutions. When it comes to your health, remedies that are stronger are not always better. I have three things that have gotten me through times when I've been depressed, and they're all gentle solutions that I think will suit an intelligent person like yourself. 

1 - The first is what Freud calls the ""talking cure"". He insists that it must be performed by a psychoanalyst who you are paying for, but actually I've performed it by writing in a diary. The key is to be very honest, and try to find connections that you might otherwise be supressing, because these are the areas that need work. For example, what's the first thing that pops into your mind when you think of ""depression""? If the answer is ""flying a kite"", then follow the chain... What do you think of when you think of ""kite"" and ""flying""... You'll be surprised how quickly this takes you right down to an event in your childhood or an unresolved conflict that might have happened a year ago.

2 - Looking for lies. A chair cannot make you depressed. A lampshade cannot make you depressed. Only another person can make you depressed. I believe it is because a chair and a lampshade cannot lie. Only a person can lie. Depression, it seems to me, comes from believing a lie. That conflict (between reality and the lie) takes up so much mental energy to maintain, it drains you as a whole. You may find, after using technique #1, that it leads to you to this conclusion #2. For example, after free associating your way to an event, you might find that it was when someone told you that you weren't worth a hill of beans. The problem is not that they insulted you, the problem is that you believed the lie. Beware, giving up on a lie that we've believed in for a long time is tougher than it sounds.

64,2842187,Question About Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.?,"I know that this is not a medical community but perhaps someone here will have information on this for me.  Opinions are also helpful.

10 years ago my b/f was in a car accident with 2 friends and he was the only survivor. Although he was not the driver in the accident he has suffered from PTSD and completely stopped driving. Since that time he has tried driving a few times but each time he tries he has so much stress that he vomits afterward (sorry for being gross) and does not look forward to trying again. 

Now he has just started an awesome job and is very excited.  We both agree that with the field he is working in it would be very good for him to be able to drive again. 

So last week he started his new job driving on his own, about 20 min. each way but is having a hard time - getting sick and stressed.

Its only been 8 days but I'm worried that this is hurting him more than helping him. Has anyone dealt with this? Do you think he might get better?  What should he do?","If you have not experienced PTSD, it's hard to explain the feeling.  If you know any older citizens who served in the Gulf War,  Vietnam War or even World War II, for instance, you can ask them about being ""shell shocked"", or PTSD.  For some people it never goes away.  I know from experience (an almost fatal auto accident that crippled me and took my professional life away at no fault of my own) that it's still there, under the surface, after 5 years.  However, I made myself get in the car and deal with it.  I think your b/f is on the right track and I'm impressed that he's willing to face his greatest fears.  You go ahead and encourage him every way you can and let him be a man and have a full life again without being co-dependent on anyone else.  He doesn't need to be an emotional cripple. What would he do if you weren't there to drive him??  He'll be proud of himself before long.  A pat on the back goes a long way.  So he might have stressful moment or two; he can learn to deal with it and get stronger and should continue to get professional help as long as he needs it.  He probably is feeling guilty as hell because he lived; not to mention every thing else involved.  Let him go...give him a nudge and hold him when he needs it.  Encourage him to help others with this problem.  Helping is great healing therapy for him and others.  He'll be living with this for a long time.

65,3049321,is this a good sign?,"hi, i never had fever or any crazy symptoms associated with my tonsilitis and strep except the horrible pain when swallowing and the redness in the back of my throat on both sides and tiny blisters. i am on penicillin VK for the 2nd week now. maybe it was the strep that led to the tonsilitis or the other way around, i dont know..why does the pain when swallowing sometimes gets better and than gets worse? is this part of the problem with this?  can the pencillin make it worse? before i took my power nap, my pain when swallowing was hardly there, then when i woke up it started getting bad again..then it goes away..is this normal with the penicillin? is it working? or is it just healing it.? sorry for all the questions   thanks","Well first of all when you first wake up your throat is dry, which makes it hurt worse, once you have been up for a little while, the pain tends to lessen.  Take the penicillin, it does work just make sure that you take the whole prescription, don't stop  taking before it's all gone.  Also strep and tonsillitis usually go hand in hand.  I have alot more experience with strep than I could ever want, so I hope this helps.  OH, P.S. If you want to feel better faster, getting the shot of penicillin works alot faster than the pills. Or another antibiotic that works wonders is the Z-pack, it's only 6 pills, you take two pills on your first day and then take one a day until they are gone, it also stays in your system for an additional week and keeps working.",,,,,,,,,the horrible pain when swallowing and the redness in the back of my throat on both sides and tiny blisters.,horrible pain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,why does the pain when swallowing sometimes gets better and than gets worse?,,,,,,Not applicable,,,

I hope i can help, i had a car crash 4 year ago, wrote off my car and the other persons car, i was driving, not my fault it takes a long time to come to terms with this kind of thing.  it is called post traumatic stress.  

A few sessions with counceling will not help, it is a long process and you need to keep going.  you can e mail me if you wish to talk about it, I am not a councelor but It may help to talk to others.

I tried to avoid the crash but could not avoid what was going to happen, luckily no one was killed just serious whiplash and a few bruises and pains.  Time heals even now I have never forgot about it but more come to accept it as unavoidable and thank the lord no one lost life that day.  I still get nervouse in traffic when I drive and it has had an impact on me as a driver but I just try to move on and it gets easier.   Fell free to mail me if you want some one to chat with it may help.  

Please consider going back to psychiatrist and give it a fair chance to work.  first few sesions is about getting to klknow you  and building up a trust with them before you will commit to talking to them I say possibly about 4 to 6 months before you feel better there.

good luck and be happy you are alive to tell the tale, many do not make it and we should all celebrate life and live each day as if it were our last because one day it will be.

take care

After injecting the dye nurse said body will remain hot and feverish and not to do any extreme exercises, until how long?
Is it normal not to find arm/elbow and hand veins (even though they are quite visible) from which to inject the dye and therefore use the thigh vein? 
Is all this normal?
Other than that no other health issues like High BP, Diabetes, CHL, EKG perfect, heart rate was a stable 90 the whole time.
Any answers are appreciated, thanks.","there is very little radiation so don't worry there unless you are pregnant.  why you had your short on in one and not the other is only the way the person that took it preference,  You usually remove everything and only wear a gown.  as for the veins not all veins are use able and you may have veins that blow very easily. When inserting the dye they need a good vein you must not have them,,  Join the club.  I always have trouble even when I have a simple blood test taken.  Having it in your thigh sucks but it is the best vein.  I hope that they find what they are looking for and sometimes you may need to have a test repeated as they do not always show the true story.

He lost 34 lbs.  I wish you all the luck!!!!

Based on a study conducted on the various types of oregano, it was determined that these herbs were able to kill bacteria due to the heavy content of phenolic substances found in their cellular structure. 

Oregano, by connecting the free radicals released from the cells within its contents, is very healthy and improves the body's cell protection system. 

Oregano prevents the formation of cancer and diabetes and regulates the level of cholesterol. This characteristic prevents tumors and slows ageing of cells. 

Natural protector: 

As we all know, many additives are used to protect food against spoiling. Although scientists believe these chemical additives have no adverse effects on humans when used properly in correct amounts, they still recommend using natural preservatives. This is where oregano comes in. It is even possible to say the miracle of oregano is that, as a natural food preserver, it eliminates the adverse effects and risks that chemical additives have. 

For Warts or Boils: Saturate affected area(s). Cover with a bandage. Repeat dressing until lesions are clear.

NOTE:Oil of Oregano can also be taken internally.

What are your experiences with bipolar disorder, and what can I do for my grandmother?","I am also bipolar, and very knowledgeable about the illness.. The doctor always knows best but has no real chance of being in a position to help if he has to make guesses at her condition. 
I am thinking that perhaps her bipolar disorder may have morphed into a more serious combination of many different afflictions as a result of her age and the traumatic loss of her life partner..
Find a way to speak with her doctor or psychiatrist and explain the finer details of her actions.. she may not be honest with him because of the paranoia of how he might try to help.. might be schizophrenia, dementia, post traumatic stress disorder.. or even being bipolar with new tendencies (it gets much worse over time, especially when treatment is abandoned and she stops the meds) 
look into these possibilities. Doctors know best, always.. but they need your help to be effective, especially in your grandmothers case.. when she isn't being very cooperative and taking a much more proactive approach towards her own wellbeing. She needs her medicine.. and she needs your help to get this under control. It seems that she is in a bad spot with being so mixed up in all of the emotions of what is happening all around her. Powerlessness is a horrible thing.. it seems she desperatly needs a helping hand.

My latest pains are spasms on the left side of throat (tonight)and chest pain on left side twice in the past 3 days. Can't sleep because the pain in the tooth keeps coming back, Water seems to soothe the pain a bit in tooth for a little while. Have felt a pressure build up on left side of face, near eye numerous times.

I seriously don't know who to go to or what to do anymore. Do i need a dentist or someone else?",Go have this seen to.

if you need any additional details plz ask but help me. doctors here in pakistan are pathetic i can't go for an ultrasound or blood test again & again...",You could be pregnant but then again there is always the chance that the home test was wrong.  They will give you false positives but almost never give you false negative answers.  Your period being late could have been from many things.  Stress being the most common factor.  The abdominal pain could be cramps that as associated with the menstral cycle. If the doctors test and the blood test say negative wait for a couple of days and then try another home test and see what it says.  Now as far as the sickness and tender breasts a lot of girls get that with their period.  The dizziness sometimes comes along with  a period because of the blood loss during that time.  Now the contipation i have no idea what to tell you about that. Like i said wait a couple of days and take another home test but you have to make sure you are off of your period before you take it to make sure the results arent messed up.

The good news is that a lot of pregnant woman find that their Migraines decrease or even disappear while pregnant.  This relief often carries through to breastfeeding and some women never experience a Migraine ever again.

You didn't say whether your doctor is your OB-Gyn or not.  Regardless, if you think your doctor is a bitc* and you don't like her, fire her!   You do not work for her.  She works for you and you pay her for her services.  You or your insurance company will be paying her a lot to deliver your child.  You deserve the best medical care for you and your unborn child and there's no reason why you have to continue seeing someone that you don't like or TRUST. 

If you don't have a doctor or a neurologist that treats your headaches, you should find one.  In case you don't know, there are doctors that limit their practice to headache treatment only.  They are called Headache Specialist.  You may be able to find one in the directory below.

[**Remember, before starting anything new, you should always discuss it with you doctor first.]
To help you get through the Migraine attacks, you might want to check into a complementary therapy(ies).  These alternatives may not abort a Migraine but it may help to ease it.  Some of these therapies include, massage, Acupuncture, Biofeedback, relaxation and/or visualization therapy, ice and/or heat packs, and aromatherapy, 

Of course it's best to be medication-free while you're pregnant.  This does not mean that there are no medications that can be taken during your pregnancy.  Dr. Lawrence Robbins, one of the top 10 headache medication experts in the US, has some great information on his website.  This excerpt from his book Headache Help discusses options including some medications that may possibly be used during pregnancy.

Printing this out and taking it with you to discuss with your doctor at your next visit may be a good idea.  Another idea is to ask your OB-Gyn to contact the doctor who treats your Migraines and maybe the 3 (Yes, I did say THREE) of you come up with a Migraine management plan TOGETHER.

Lastly, Migraine is not a just a bad headache.  It's not caused by too much stress (although stress can exacerbate it)  or other emotional issues.  It is a real genetic neurological disease that there is no cure for.   Migraines can be completely disabling and the pain can be the worst you've ever experienced in your entire life.  It's is very important to remember that Migraine pain lasting more than 72 hours with less than a solid 4 hours relief can be dangerous and should be considered an emergency requiring an doctor visit or or a trip to the emergency room.","pregnancy, migraines",,Female,,horrible pain,migraines,,,,,dr is a bitc*,If you haven't experienced this for your self it's not possible to know the pain.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Does anyone know what I can do that will help me?

I know how hard it is, I spend the first day crying to my husband and my mom. I don't feel like I should be having to deal with this at 23. Go for a pelvic ultrasound, and that way you will be able to see if there are cysts on your ovaries. And i suggest getting  a consulatation with a fertility specialist if you haven't already.

25,1716638,Is Gluten related to acne and depression (or other mental disorders)?,"After living in Korea for a few years, I returned to Canada. Within a few months bad acne started to appear on my back, and my energy levels became sluggish. 
In Korea, I ate a typical Korean diet consisting of rice, tons of veggies, sushi, no cooked meat, and very rarely ate bread. 
Upon returning to Canada, I was excited to eat sandwiches, and subs. So my diet is basically the same now, except the bread.
I know there is a connection. What other effects can Gluten have on people's general overall health?","Diet is o_ne of the most controversial areas of discussion when it comes to the topic of health in the modern age. Biological studies suggest that there is a direct link between acne and diet. In fact, some researchers say a poor diet is responsible for up to 90% of all acne-related cases. Unfortunately, when it comes to diet everyone's dietary needs and tolerances to different foods are different.

You should make sure that you avoid any foods you are allergic to. Testing is available at allergy specialists' offices to find out which foods you are either intolerant or allergic to. If this is not an option the best way to see if a particular food is causing or aggrevating your acne is to go o_n an elimination diet. By o_nly following a detox diet, you can't really see which foods your skin tolerates or not because the diet is so restrictive. I think a better way and easier way in the long term is to pick o_ne possible acne-causing food group and eliminate it from your diet for a couple of months to see if there is any improvement. For example, you can start with dairy foods...you continue to eat your normal diet but you eliminate all dairy for two months. If it works, great, if not then you can reintroduce dairy and pick another food group like high glycemic/refined carbohydrates...you do the same thing and see if it helps. As a normal rule the basic potentially acne-causing foods to test out are: dairy, carbs, high fat/fried foods, copper-rich foods and iodine-rich foods. By eliminating o_ne at a time, it will be much easier to follow than eating o_nly fruits nuts and veggies.

These following diets have been popular, and have proved successful in clearing acne for many acne sufferers.

Diet 1 - Dairy Free: No dairy, that means no cowï¿½s milk or any of the foods that are derived from cowï¿½s milk such as: cheese, yogurt, lactose, or dairy whey ext. Dairy foods contain many different drugs and hormones that come from the cowï¿½s body. Cows are fed grain with antibiotics added to the grain to prevent the cows from getting cow diseases such as mastitis. Mastitis is an inflammation of the cows udders. Antibiotics fed to cows pass into the milk, and milk products that we consume. These added antibiotics to our diets through consumption of dairy foods can cause some of us other physical problems as well as aggravate acne. Some researchers believe that feeding so many antibiotics to food animals can make diseases that people get become antibiotic resistant. Cows are fed hormones to increase their milk production. Women are especially affected by ingesting milk products from animals that have been fed hormones as supplements. Many people are also intolerant to the lactose in dairy. Lactose is milk sugar. This intolerance can induce diarrhea in some individuals.

Diet 2 - Gluten Free: Eliminate all gluten containing food products, which include Wheat, Barley, Rye and others. Around 30% of people have been shown to be intolerant to gluten to some degree. This intolerance creates digestive problems which creates inflammation in the gut. The inflammation that is created is a cause of acne in persons who have this particular digestive problem. Many chronic diseases are initially caused by various food intolerances such as the gluten intolerance so by eliminating this problem you eliminate a cause of acne, and you also eliminate a cause of possible future disease.

Diet 3 - Lectin Free: Lectins are sugar-binding proteins that mimic insulin. They bind to carbohydrates, and to various proteins. This binding action causes your body to attack itself, which in turn creates inflammation. This inflammation leads to more acne, among many other physiological problems. The Lectin-Free diet restricts things like grains, nightshades (ie. peppers, tomatoes, potatoes), legumes (ie. beans) and some starches.

He gets through most of it with a lot of support from his family and with professional therapy. This is not something that is going to just go away you have to work on it every day. First you have to know that when Jesus died on the cross he didn't say ok I forgive every one but you. You deserve it just as much as anyone else. Even He forgave those who put him on the cross. You need to pray and be thankful of this everyday. Speak to God as your constant companion in everything you do and you feel the difference. He is your Father and loves you as such. Second try to find a counselor you are comfortable with that you can express you thoughts and feelings to so you can stop the cycle of thoughts roaring in your head. It also helps if you can write them down, make sure you write all of them down. You don't ever have to read them again and you can destroy the pages if you like but you should still write down your thoughts. 

Finally and this is important, we learned after several years of bad doctors and wrong medications that a heart condition can cause and worsen this problem. Its called mitral valve prolapse and it messes up the autonomic system so that your chemistry is never normal. You should be check out for this as your heart can get worse with time and sometimes a beta blocker used for high blood pressure can help with your thoughts. Until you do get your heart checked out be sure to stay away from any mental health drugs because this condition also alters their effects.

She must be as worried as you are, but the less stress she has to deal with the better. Give her as much support and understanding as you can.
This does sound like epiepsy and not a mental illness, I don't know why people have said that. It can make her 'spaced out' and unaware of her surroundings, and hear sounds and voices, and smell odd smells; especially just before she has a fit.
I can't imagine what all this feels like from her point of view but she must be aware that her friends don't go through this. Its tough and very unfair on you both. At least you are aware there's a problem and are getting her help.
When you go to the hospital take a pen and paper and write things down, when they are telling you a lot of stuff it gets difficult to remember. Ask them to spell things if you don't know how. If the consultant can't speak to you in plain english just keep asking ""what does that mean in laymans tems"" until you get a straight answer. Ask for leaflets and support groups.
And also don't forget that you will need support too.

I am however having a completely different problem today and it started yesterday while I was deep cleaning my mom's house.  The stabbing pain is on the left side of my back ranging from my shoulder blade down to my kidney.  I also have the same pain in my right shoulder (from the top to my neck).  The pain is tingly and stabbing at the same time.  When I move the pain changes and I can get into a position where I don't feel it at all.  Does anyone with experience know if the problem I'm having has to do with nerves or simply pulled muscles?  I've had many sore muscles in my days but have never felt anything like this.  I'm mainly asking because I know I won't be able to get in to see my doctor until at least Monday and I need to know if I should take it easy or try to continue moving around.  I appreciate any advice I can get.  Thanks!,"It does seem like a nerve problem, probably compression of a nerve(s). Do not strain your back.

Fevers do the same thing as the foci of the infection has affected a specific area.

71,3353726,Questions about herpes?,"In August I was diagnosed with Herpes, and my outbreak was pretty bad.  I had sores in my cervix, urethra, and some in my vaginal opening.  About 1 week ago, I had my second outbreak.  This time much much less severe.  It was only a small bump on the vaginal lip and was gone within 4-5 days.  I know it was a herpes outbreak because I went to the doctor.  Now, I have several small clustered bumps on my inner thigh, that release clear liquid and itch.  I don't know where that came from.  I have not had sexual intercourse between the two outbreaks.  My questions are this:

1. I know that herpes is contagious, but is it contagious within your own body?  Meaning, if I touched the sore that was on the vaginal lip, and then touched my inner thigh, is my thigh now infected with the virus?

2.  Can an outbreak be so close together?  It was only a week ago that I had my second outbreak.  

Please help, serious answers only please.  

Thanks a lot!","The Herpes virus causes both the outbreak that you can get on your genitals, and also is the cause of coldsores that you get around your mouth (although I've heard that if you have one, you cannot get the other). It is incurable (unfortunatly) but for most people, outbreaks are rare, and in some cases after the initial outbreak, they never have another (although they still carry the virus). It an be transmitted from area to area both on your own body and from person to person. Again in some cases, outbreaks will clear up on their own without any medication, however if an outbreak is severe, or doens't go away you should see your doctor. Your thigh is infected with the virus and outbreaks can be close together. In the same way as coldsores, outbreaks tend to happen when you are stressed or feeling under the weather as your immune system isn't at top levels. To help prevent further outbreaks keep your vitamin intake high, especially vit. C by eating lots of fresh, uncooked fruit and veg and drinking lots of OJ. You will always carry the virus (unless they find a cure) so always use a condom when having sex to prevent further infection to other people and always wash your hands after touching an infected area to prevent further infection on yourself. Also, if the doctor didn't already do it, get checked out for other STDs. Ones like Chlamydia often have no symptoms but can casue infertility and if yuo have Herpes, you may have other STDs.",herpes,,Female,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I don't know where that came from.,I have not had sexual intercourse,,,,,is it contagious within your own body?

All the crying, gas,etc came right back within 2 days.  So, back we go to Enfamil Nutramigen!!!

""Paget's Disease of the Nipple

This type of breast cancer starts in the milk ducts and spreads to the skin of the nipple and areola (the dark circle around the nipple). The nipple and areola will often appear crusted, scaly and red. The patient may experience burning, itching or notice some bloody discharge from the nipple.

Paget's Disease is a rare form of breast cancer, occurring in only 1% of all cases. It can be associated with in situ carcinoma as well as invasive carcinoma. If no lump can be felt in the breast tissue and the biopsy shows the growth to be in situ and not invasive, treatment for Paget's Disease is very effective.""

I would suggest doing a search on this term as I am positive there can be many contributing factors. For now I am sure the doctor will rule out all the possible causes.

Yesterday Thursday May 18th , I took my 1 month old baby to the pediatrician due to what it looked to me like a belly-button infection (since there was a little puss coming out of it). Well the doctor said it wasnt an infection but that she had a hernia. Well she didnt tell me to do anything about it. Unleast it got worse. Today she got blood coming out of it . I called at 7:30 the doctor told me that is still nothing to worry about. I dont really trust them so I wanted a second opinion. Couldve this been prevented when I took her yesterday?What was the right procedure to take ..Cause If so , I would really look foward to changing to a better practitioner..","umbilical hernias (that's what it is ) are very common and usually go away on there own by the time a child is about 3 but when they bleed that is a sign it needs to be treated.
what they do with common hernias is go in through a lapriscope and sew in a piece of mesh to hold the area so it can heal properly, I am not totally certain they do the same with umbilical hernias.
 My son had an epigastric hernia and the first pediatrician I talked to said ohh it was nothing (not hernia or anything)second said it will go away but the third said those kind never heal themselves, wow am I glad I got additional opinions!!!

I have NO swelling, full range of motion, no discoloration, no prior history of knee problems- ever. There was no ""sudden injury"" - exercise a lot and it started hurting after a long day of working out. The pain is mainly on the inner side of my left knee. I also feel a soreness over my kneecap, but I'm not sure if that's just secondary pain. I'm not taking anti-inflammatories because I'm afraid that they will interfere with the healing process. The pain isn't killing me, but it bothers me and I'm afraid that this isn't going to get better.  I can walk without a limp, but honestly I do feel tenderness and a little pain when I do walk. I have icing the injury 3 times a day and am not sure if I should continue icing my knee since there has never been any visible swelling.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!","It sounds to me as though it is a MCL strain.  If your knee starts to click, give way or lock, there is more of a problem.  Avoid twisting on the knee and going upstairs with it first.

I would start using heat on the area.  This will increase the circulation and the healing to the area.  If at any time you start to feel increased pain with the heat, stop and return to the ice.

Knees are strange creatures.  Even one teaspoon of extra fluid/swelling within the knee joint can stop the thigh muscles working for 3-5 days.  It is virtually impossible to tell if this small amount of swelling is even present - not even an MRI would detect it!

Try using a simple knee brace when you are up and about, even an ACE wrap would help.  This will just give you an extra bit of support, but do not rely upon braces - they can actually make you weaker in the long term.

If things do not calm down in the next 5-7 days, ask your doctor for a referal to a good physical therapist.

Opps. Accidently deleted the last one. I suffer with allergies throughout the whole year, which often times turn into Sinus Infections. I've tried Claritin, Allegra, Zyrtec, and Nasacort AQ. None of them seem to work. The Nasacort AQ works for maybe 3 hours and that's it. I've also tried herbs (Fenugreek, ALJ-contains thyme, fenugreek, goldenseal, and Mullein). 
I'm going to the doctor again on Tuesday to see what we can do because now my lips are extremely dried out and feel like they're burning. I have no food allergies that I know of. I have had allergic reactions before to things like Nair, make-up, and detergent, but that's it. I've also gotten sensitive to smoke within the past year. It flares it up right away now.

27,3265896,std? prostatitis?,"everytime after sex, my right ball swells and this discharge comes out. i have been to the doctor countless times. this time, i had anal on a one night stand. didn't cum. 3 days later, the swell came back. there is kinda mild sticky discharge. i did use a condom. is it mechanical urethritis or the right ball malfunctioning? it happens everytime after sex and there been many times the doctor said there was no sign of infection.","did your doctor give you a blood test? This should have been done initially if you suspected an STD which it does sound like. 
Many doctors in this day and age are beginning to decrease the amount of STD tests done, stupid it know, as they believe the STD epidemic is declining as people become more familiar with safe sex.

Back to your question, has this always happend when you have had sex? No? Then something has obviously developed. Either demand further testing from your doctor or give him/her a sample on the spot. Yes I mean go out and obtain a sample of the gunk on a swab. If you tell the doctor before hand they should be able to give you a pathology swab with a special tube to keep it in. 

Another variation on your symptoms is a blockage of the ducts out of the scrotum, this would cause a blockage and swelling of the vessels giving the illusion your right ball is swallon. Once the body acts to right this wrong the semen would ooze out as it is the only place it can go.

Either way you need to see a specialist if your doctor is being complacent about the issue!

So I am wondering if she is really experiencing asthma symptoms or just out-of-breatheness that comes with starting an exercize regimen. 

I myself have had breathing problems after a strenuous workout, but overcame them by getting in shape, so it's difficult for me to gauge whether or not what she is experiencing is asthma.","Features that suggest shortness of breath is due to asthma would include a wheeze when breathing out and a cough that produces mucus.  Since asthma is, by definition, reversible airways obstruction, her symptoms should improve when she takes her blue inhaler (assuming her 'reliever' inhaler is blue).  Next time she exercises she should take her blue 'ventolin/salbutamol' inhaler 20 minutes before exercise to see if that prevents her symptoms from occuring.  Exercise induced asthma is often worse in cold weather, when the person has a cold and at other times, such as when the pollen count is high.

Like eczema and hayfever, many people with purely exercise induced asthma grow out of it.

Maybe she needs to go to her doctor for a review of her asthma status and medication.",Athsma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,I am wondering if she is really experiencing asthma symptoms,,,,,,Not applicable,,,

Not all schizophrenia is chronic schizophrenia (although, alas, most cases probably are chronic and long-lasting) An acute psychotic episode is where they had psychotic symptoms in reaction to a stressor and the symptoms went away with treatment. It is also possible that he had a depressive disorder of psychotic proportion that was misdiagnosed. Major depression is usually episodic so it might be that it remitted. Finally, it is possible that he used psychoactive drugs and it precipitated a psychotic episode (for example, amphetimines--speed--can cause amphetimine psychosis that mimics paranoid schizophrenia).

It is certainly possible to hide the symptoms, but not easy. Does anyone else in his family have a depressive or psychotic disorder?

If you are presenting, a AP/Lateral would be useful. Your description of 'extreme irritability' is vague...to sound, to touch, or restlessness.

While it sounds nice, be a protective mama bear and watch over your little cub.  I used to tell people that I'm a very peaceful person unless someone messes with my children.  Then, I'm a mama bear and you just messed with my cubs!

Keep her close.  She may be disappointed now, but someday she will understand how much you love her.

People accused me of keepng my daughters too close and sheltering them.  Well.... they are now young adult women.  We have had no smoking, no drinking, no drugs, no premarital sex (older daughter was a virgin on her wedding night).  Seems to me that I did a pretty good job.

As they got older I talked to them a lot about life.  They learned what to say to boys, to have self-respect, and to take care of themselves.  

So to the nay-sayers who think we should let our kids run the streets nowadays..... I point to the kids who've died in the streets, been molested, abused, etc.  None of that happened to my kids, so they should just back up off of it.

1. Low preasure front in your area. Is it about to rain or an overcast day?
2. Triggered by food allergies? Such as Cheese, food colouring, red wine, alcohol, Red wine vinegar, ginger chocolate., and many more can be added to this list. 
Also watch for the combination of 1 and 2 togather. As one trigger alone amy not be enough to cause a headach.
Also signs of a migrain headach: sensitivity to light and sound.

Can result in dry coughing (which is vomiting until you have nothing left in you but your body keeps vomiting anyway, painfull)

 Treatment : cartain Migraine medication prescribed by your doctor.  or ADVIL / ADVIL LIQUID / MIGRAINE ADVIL. 
Never take Tylenol for a Migrain head ache as Tylenol will cause 'rebound' headaches a day or two latter which can be just as bad or worse than the original head ache. Don't wait until the pain is too terrible before taking an ADVIL as delaying can result in vomiting and dry coughing which could have been otherwise avoided.

37,2490427,Any dentists out there? Need help with root canal problems.?,"I had root canals on my #3 molar and my #4 pre-molar. The #3 seemed fine and I got the permanent crown and had no problems. Shortly after having the rtc in the #4 I got the problems. I acquired an ache, and had biting pressure. I went to 3 endo doc's and all 3 agreed that the problems were in the #3. The tooth was extracted as a last resort. Now the problems have seemed to move to the #4 tooth. It is not sensitive to hot/ cold, but seems to have a minor ache at times. I am also lightheaded (could be totally unrelated). I have been back and had the tooth checked again by  the endo's and they see no problems. They say that it could be neuralgia? My general dentist, oral surgeon and endo all seem to agree on neuralgia. Is it worth seeking another opinion? I have been given antibiotics, but no change seems to occur. Any suggestions. The tooth has been trimmed so I don't hit it when I bite, and it has not been crowned. Any help is appreciated.","There is a condition out there called Trigeminal Neuralgia, rare, but it does exist.  Unfortunately, you hear of cases, where people get Root Canal after Root Canal, even extractions and the pain still remains present.  I would get a 2nd opinion from a Neurologist and/or someone who specializes in Facial Pain to see if they can rule out the possibilities of Trigeminal Neuralgia (it is called that because it affects the Trigeminal Nerve).

I, too, doubt it would be cancer, but I must strongly disagree that ""you would know if you had skin cancer"". That's simply not true, and it's the reason why so many people aren't diagnosed until it's too late.

Do you exercise much, or has the weather changed lately? It could be a bit of prickly heat. I get it from time to time and your description sounds similar to what I experience. If it's prickly heat, in an adult it's usually nothing to worry about and will go away - though the thing that makes me doubt this diagnosis is that it doesn't bother you at all. Prickly heat is often quite irritating, but then, everyone's different.

49,222746,What happens after preeclamsia?,"When I was pregnant with my son (my first and only pregenancy) I was diagnosed with preeclampsia. Because of that my obstetrician induced labor two weeks before my due date and took the baby via a c-section as he was concerned that my blood pressure was going up despite my medication dosage being increased. After I had my son and went to visit my doctor for my 6 weeks check up, I was told that my blood pressure had returned to normal. However a few months ago (January/ Febuary) I had to go to the doctor, and during that time when a routine blood pressure check was done, the doctor found that my blood pressure was high. I was prescribed medication for a few days to settle it; the doctor thought the blood pressure could have risen because of lack f rest. However recently I have found that my heart at times gives this fluttering feeling and my pulse races at times. I'm going to have a medical check-up, but is this a sign that I'm hypertensive at just 26 years old?!","Wow, you kinda tucked two questions in there.  One at a time...

(1)  What happens after preeclamsia? 
A:  PREeclampsia is a set of three conditions:  hypertension, protein in the urine, and edema (swelling).  Eclampsia is what happens after preeclampsia, and that's a seizure.  Preeclampsia is VERY serious, the usual treatment is to end your pregnacy (usually but not always, with an induced delivery).  However, preeclampsia can happen up to (but not more than) six weeks following delivery.  What ever is going on with you is NOT preeclampsia.  

(2)  but is this a sign that I'm hypertensive at just 26 years old?! 
A:  Fluttering and racing pulses are not related to hypertension.  They may be serious, they may not.  The hypertension that you went through was most likely due to a shallow implantation of your fetus.  If the fetus doesn't implant deep enough into your uterus, then the arteries feeding the placenta cannot grow big enough, and your body compensates by increasing its blood pressure in an effor to nourish the child.  Preeclampsia is definately not a concern.  But that doesn't mean there can't be other things wrong too.",preeclampsia,25-34 years old,Female,,,,,,recently I have found that my heart at times gives this fluttering feeling and my pulse races at times.,my blood pressure was high / preeclampsia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,is this a sign that I'm hypertensive at just 26 years old?!,,,,,,Not applicable,,,

71,1724967,Does my 3 year old have Tourettes?,"A couple of days ago (about 6) my son started ""double blinking"" and it started after he hung out with his half uncle who has Tourettes. I don't know if he picked it up, if it is a nervous habit or if he really has Tourette. My husband is telling me not to worry about it because him and his brother don't have the same dad...and it is genetic. I have taken him to his pedatrician today and she pretty much refered me to a Neuroligist to check him out. If I let them give him an ECG (is that right?) will it definatley let me know if he has tourettes or is it pretty hard to discover? I think Im going to cancel the appt. and see what happens in a month or so. See if anyother tics have developed. Has anyone else ever dealt with this? What symptoms should I be watching for? Thanks for your help.","Tourettes is a Neurological disorder in the brain.  It is not contagious.  The conventional wisdom is that it is hereditary, but there has been recent genetic research that may suggest otherwise. (I have the info, please let me know if you'd like it).

Three is pretty early for symptoms to start, but not impossible.  My recommendation is keen observation, notes, and a video camera.  

An EEG is good, but not a determining factor in diagnosing Tourettes.  It will, however, rule out any seizure disorders, and that is important.  There is no ""one"" test for Tourettes.  It is diagnosed by observation in the Dr. office and your oral history.
DO THIS:  While he is playing alone and there are minimal distractions, video tape him without him knowing.  This will prevent him from ""hamming it up"" for the camera.  This information will help tremendously in the diagnostic process.  Your notes and observations will also be vital to the process.  We did this (video tape) with our son when the tics and vocal tremors were very obvious, just in case they were not present during the prescribed day and time of the appointment. 

Tourettes is difficult to diagnose in small children because it is difficult to know if the movements and/or sounds they are making are in their control.  And since he is so young, it would be difficult to ask him.  If you have referral a Pediatric Neurologist in your area, I would keep the appointment as an office/information visit.  Assuming the tics continue,  bring your video camera (to show that tape) and your husband with you.  For some reason, a Doctor will take a set of parents seriously and not attribute what you are saying to ""a hysterical mom"".   Start a relationship with this doctor.  This will help over the years.  

ABOVE ALL stay calm.  Having a child with Tourettes is not the worst thing in the world.  You will find this to be true when you spend any amount of time in a Pediatric Neurology waiting room.  And please ignore the stupid, uninformed, and rude answers that will come. Coprolalia (cursing) occurs in a VERY SMALL number of TS patients and is not a requirement for a diagnosis.

If your child has TS, the most important thing to do for him is to provide a safe, stress free (as much as possible) home environment where he is allowed to tic without comment from others.  Unconditional acceptance is imperative.

72,1877901,questions about salmonella poisoning?,"I read that it takes 6 hours to 72hours for salmonella poisoning to show, but is there a way the doctor can check before then? I'm asking because my husband was cooking chicken and my daughter (who's 1_)  reached on the counter and grabbed a piece and licked it when he wasnt watching. he took it from her and told me what she did, so i flushed her mouth out and washed her hands vigarously with antibacterial soap. I am wondering because I'm scared and I dont know if I should go to the ER or wait til I see the symptoms. 
Let me say I AM NOT a bad mother, nor my husband a bad father. Mistakes do happen and my daughter has just now started reaching up. 
I NEED SERIOUS ANSWERS ONLY! 
thanks","Hey, accidents happen and kids will be kids.  My two-year old gets into everything as well.

Just keep an eye on her for the next three days.  If she starts showing symptoms, then go to the doctor/ER.

Don't worry, she will probably be OK.

From Yahoo! Health:
""Symptoms of salmonellosis include diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps. They develop 12 to 72 hours after infection, and the illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. However, diarrhea and dehydration may be so severe that it is necessary to go to the hospital. Older adults, infants, and those with impaired immune systems are at highest risk.""",salmonella poisoning,,,,,,,,I am wondering because I'm scared and I dont know if I should go to the ER or wait til I see the symptoms.,salmonella poisoning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Let me say I AM NOT a bad mother, nor my husband a bad father.

Thanks :)","Most commonly what you are experiencing is some slight swelling in your biceps muscle, causing it slip over a spot in the upper arm bone (humerus). Couple things you can do to help. Make sure you are always stretching well before and after weights, ice and Advil for any pain, and make sure you are not overtraining or using incoreect mechanics. It probably won't go away, but if it gets any worse you may need to back off the harder shoulder work and use less weight.

Any advice?,"I suggest getting her into a rehabilition program there are great ones all over the country that deal with just eating disorders or have a speciality program from them.  The best way to help her is not to ask but give. You and your parents need to have a sit down with her. (An intervention) You all need to write down everything that you love about, what her best qualities are, and what you see happening to her. Also a good tacket is if telling her all that stuff doesn't work, have her lay down on the couch close her eyes and have her a ""funeral"" (I know it sounds bad,but it really does help) she is not aloud to talk. But you all come up to her say everything you love. And talk about how the disorder killed her and how it has affected you. Tell her what ended up happening to all of you after she died. Like for example you started failing in school and ended up with the same eating disorder she had. And mom started losing weight because she was so depressed she would forget, she lost her job because the boss couldn't handle her crying infront of clients. Dad was never home anymore because he couldn'e handle everything, he became an alcoholic. Their is constant fighting.

Also, to help with the bloody nose, try not to blow too hard or rub your nose too much.  You need to give yourself time to heal and let the inflammation subside.

Thanks!","My son is having it done this Friday for his lower front teeth (both, I believe.)  He also needs a Frenulectomy (where they snip that little piece of skin tht connects your lower lip to your bottom gums) because his is too short & is what caused his gums to recede.  The total cost for both is around $970.  (I'm expecting the insurance to cover about 80% of that.) They say the graft site on the roof of your mouth feels like it might feel after getting burned from eating really hot pizza.  But since my son is only 8, we're going with the alloderm grafts instead, because it will be less invasive & less painful for him.   The peridontist said the whole thing should take about 1/2 hr to 45 minutes.  Supposedly the mouth heals very quickly, so I'm sure he'll be good to go by Monday.  We were told he will need to eat cold & soft foods for the next day or so & gradually return to a normal diet.    As far as what it will look like, I don't even think we'll ever see it unless we look for it, since it's the bottom 2 teeth, which are almost always hidden by his lip, anyway.

Based on a study conducted on the various types of oregano, it was determined that these herbs were able to kill bacteria due to the heavy content of phenolic substances found in their cellular structure. 

Oregano, by connecting the free radicals released from the cells within its contents, is very healthy and improves the body's cell protection system. 

Oregano prevents the formation of cancer and diabetes and regulates the level of cholesterol. This characteristic prevents tumors and slows ageing of cells. 

Natural protector: 

As we all know, many additives are used to protect food against spoiling. Although scientists believe these chemical additives have no adverse effects on humans when used properly in correct amounts, they still recommend using natural preservatives. This is where oregano comes in. It is even possible to say the miracle of oregano is that, as a natural food preserver, it eliminates the adverse effects and risks that chemical additives have. 

For Warts or Boils: Saturate affected area(s). Cover with a bandage. Repeat dressing until lesions are clear.

NOTE:Oil of Oregano can also be taken internally. You can find it at any health food store or G.N.C",natural remedies / flat warts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I think using bandaids with a solution would be rather perilous..,rather perilous,I think using bandaids with a solution would be rather perilous..,rather perilous,,,,,,,Is there anything like natural capsules or pills I could take from a Natural Health Store to fight them QUICK from the inside??,,,,,,Not applicable,,,

Cancer, heart disease, hypertension, brain/mood disorders, inflammation, etc. are related to trans fats.  No level of intake is 'safe', which is why the law allowing small amounts in foods to pass as 'no trans fats' is a 'bit of a problem'.

Find a way to speak with her doctor or psychiatrist and explain the finer details of her actions.. she may not be honest with him because of the paranoia of how he might try to help.. might be schizophrenia, dementia, post traumatic stress disorder.. or even being bipolar with new tendencies (it gets much worse over time, especially when treatment is abandoned and she stops the meds) 
look into these possibilities. Doctors know best, always.. but they need your help to be effective, especially in your grandmothers case.. when she isn't being very cooperative and taking a much more proactive approach towards her own wellbeing. She needs her medicine.. and she needs your help to get this under control. It seems that she is in a bad spot with being so mixed up in all of the emotions of what is happening all around her. Powerlessness is a horrible thing.. it seems she desperatly needs a helping hand. 
Educate yourself to whatever the possibilities for her behavior might be in a clinical sense so you can be helpful to the doctors.

6,2842187,Question About Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.?,"I know that this is not a medical community but perhaps someone here will have information on this for me.  Opinions are also helpful.

10 years ago my b/f was in a car accident with 2 friends and he was the only survivor. Although he was not the driver in the accident he has suffered from PTSD and completely stopped driving. Since that time he has tried driving a few times but each time he tries he has so much stress that he vomits afterward (sorry for being gross) and does not look forward to trying again. 

Now he has just started an awesome job and is very excited.  We both agree that with the field he is working in it would be very good for him to be able to drive again. 

So last week he started his new job driving on his own, about 20 min. each way but is having a hard time - getting sick and stressed.

Its only been 8 days but I'm worried that this is hurting him more than helping him. Has anyone dealt with this? Do you think he might get better?  What should he do?","If you have not experienced PTSD, it's hard to explain the feeling.  If you know any older citizens who served in the Gulf War,  Vietnam War or even World War II, for instance, you can ask them about being ""shell shocked"", or PTSD.  For some people it never goes away.  I know from experience (an almost fatal auto accident that crippled me and took my professional life away at no fault of my own) that it's still there, under the surface, after 5 years.  However, I made myself get in the car and deal with it.  I think your b/f is on the right track and I'm impressed that he's willing to face his greatest fears.  You go ahead and encourage him every way you can and let him be a man and have a full life again without being co-dependent on anyone else.  He doesn't need to be an emotional cripple. What would he do if you weren't there to drive him??  He'll be proud of himself before long.  A pat on the back goes a long way.  So he might have stressful moment or two; he can learn to deal with it and get stronger and should continue to get professional help as long as he needs it.  He probably is feeling guilty as hell because he lived; not to mention every thing else involved.  Let him go...give him a nudge and hold him when he needs it.  Encourage him to help others with this problem.  Helping is great healing therapy for him and others.  He'll be living with this for a long time.

8,1502483,Is this normal?,"Is this normal? The last two days I have had hard bowel movements that have caused me to bleed. I am a 25 year old female and weigh 115 pounds (and no I am not menstruating).  I usually have normal bowel movements, and I also have IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) which causes a soft stool and more frequent bowel movements than normal. I have IBS as a result of having E-coli in 2000 (the Walkerton, Ontario Canada E-coli disaster) Iï¿½m sure you heard about it on the news. The whole town had bloody diarrhea. 

Anywho, that was the last time I had blood in my stool. However, I do not think that I have E-coli right now, but because I did have it before it raises some concern. I do not believe I have e-coli because when I did have it I had horrible cramping and bloody diarrhea. Right now, the last two days I have had no cramping, my stool is hard and the blood I donï¿½t think is actually in my stool, I think it is the direct result of my hard bowel movement. Anyways, the question that I am asking is, is this normal? Has anyone else experienced this? And what is your opinion on my condition? Is this a result of not enough exercise or something that I ate or something else? Should I be concerned?

- Worried.","Don't worry too muvh!
A friend had the same concern recently.But it's not too serious, as you said, he was told the blood was due to stressing to pass the stool.But he was advised to avoid future occurrences as it can become serious if you develop hemorrhages inside(due to the straining).

One problem with an ICD is that it sometimes delivers shocks when you do not need them. Even though a shock lasts a very short time, you can usually feel it. Every shock you feel should be notified to your doctor. The settings of the ICD may need to be adjusted or your medications may need to be changed.ICD problems can sometimes be prevented by programming the device to sound an alert when there is a problem. This can be done by your electrophysiologist. If you heart your ICD alert, you should immediately call your doctor.
WARNING: In June 2005, certain ICD models and biventricular pacemaker-defibrillators were recalled by the manufacturer because of a circuitry flaw that prevents the devices from delivering therapeutic electrical shocks when needed. The problem may result in patient death. Two deaths are believed to be associated with the malfunction. Although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration did not make any specific recommendations, the agency encourages patients who may have such a device to ask their health care doctor if they should have it removed or replaced. The devices affected by this recall are:

""Paget's Disease of the Nipple

This type of breast cancer starts in the milk ducts and spreads to the skin of the nipple and areola (the dark circle around the nipple). The nipple and areola will often appear crusted, scaly and red. The patient may experience burning, itching or notice some bloody discharge from the nipple.

Paget's Disease is a rare form of breast cancer, occurring in only 1% of all cases. It can be associated with in situ carcinoma as well as invasive carcinoma. If no lump can be felt in the breast tissue and the biopsy shows the growth to be in situ and not invasive, treatment for Paget's Disease is very effective.""

49,2875234,Side effects of hemorrhoidectomies?,"I hope I spelled it right.
I ask this question because I'm gay and I wanna know if after having hemorrhoids surgically removed, I'd still be able to have anal sex, if it would be painful or not, if I would bleed, if there's a chance of becoming impotent (as I read once), etc.
And another thing, while having the problem (not having yet the operation), what could happen if you have sex, and if you use lubricant?
Oh, and is ""Anusol"" anything like Prep H? Cuz we don't have Prep H here but we do have Anusol.
Thanks a lot!","There is not a lot of info out there regarding what can happen after surgery.  You might search out a doctor who is comfortable talking about these issues.  Here is some info I found:

Anal sex shouldn't hurt. Having hemorrhoids can make anal sex painful. People who find anal sex painful often do not use enough water-based lube; others are not relaxed or aroused enough. Using lots of lube  which makes anal (and vaginal) sex more slippery and wet  can increase pleasure for both you and your partner. Relaxation will also minimize or prevent the possibility of tearing the thin lining of the rectum, and make insertion easier and more comfortable. Some people relax by taking a warm bath; others begin with a massage, starting with the butt and inner thighs, then gently playing in and around the anal sphincter with a finger. As the sensations become more comfortable and pleasurable, some people experiment by placing more fingers inside the anus. Others might progress to a small sex toy, or be ready to be penetrated by a larger toy, or even a penis. Communication with your partner about what feels good and how you want to be touched is essential for enjoyable anal play.

Although you can have anal sex when you have hemorrhoids, it's better to wait until they've healed. Friction and pressure from penetration can cause further irritation, discomfort, and pain. In addition, hemorrhoids that bleed may place you at increased risk for HIV infection, since the HIV virus can be transmitted more easily through an open ""cut"" or ""wound."" Whenever you have anal sex  if you have hemorrhoids or not  it's safer to use condoms and lube if you don't know your partner's HIV status.  http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/1925.html?CFID=277115&CFTOKEN=97076474
I am a woman who recently experienced my first hemorrhoids. They were painful, revolting and extremely embarrassing. Sitting in the stirrups while my doctor treated them was humiliating enough -- I couldn't bear to ask her this question: how long should I wait before I have anal sex? PAIN IN THE... 

Again with the ass and me calling doctors! The Hassle Free Clinic says you can proceed with anal sex ""when you feel comfortable,"" but use plenty of lube and take it slow. 

Some invasive surgery in the genital/anal area takes about six weeks to heal completely, but a hemorrhoidectomy, according to Heidi at Dr. Stubbs' office, may take only a week, depending on the severity of your condition and whether the procedure is done at a hospital or clinic. Looks like you'll be riding that red-eye flight again in no time.

50,107231,concerning my daughter?,"it all started when she was 2 months pregnant. the nauseas feeling, even throwing up. But there was also excruciating pain in the stomach. it got so severe that she ended up spending most of the pregnancy in the hospitals with a demerol drip. she has been to all the hospitals in the area plus some that are 50 miles away. Given all the test that the doctors can imagine. Her veins colapsed from all the needles. no one can figure out what is going on. It has been a year and a half since she delivered a healthy little girl, but the pain and vomiting still persist. Has anyone out there ever gone through this and can you tell me what is going on. Its not her pancreas, galbladder, intestines or anything that the doctors can put a finger on.   Please help, we are desparate.","First, is your daughter taking any supplements or prescription medications - especially prescription ones?  When you are taking a prescription and complain about a possible side effect, most doctors won't believe you if your complaint is not one of those listed as a potential side effect  by the drug manufacturer.  Yet as we know, each body is different.  Therefore whatever you are experiencing could be a little known side effect.  When drug companies conduct clinical trials, they often don't report findings that are less than .5% of the test population.  If you happen to be part of that .5%, however, you know that what you experienced is very real, indeed.

I recently underwent a host of tests for recurrent nausea and vomiting.  My mother asked me about medications I was taking and  immediately homed in on one of my medications as one she had been unable to take.  Nausea and vomiting were not listed as possible side effects, but on the advice of my mother and under the care of my physician, I quit taking the medicine in question.  In only three days, the problem was resolved.

If your daughter's problem cannot be tied to a medication or supplement she is ingesting, my next question would be whether or not she has seen an allergist.  Some food allergies can cause nausea and vomiting.  Of course, there are usually accompanying symptoms like edema or rash if that it the case.

A final question would be whether your daughter has been evaluated by an endocrinologist?  I had a friend whose daughter suffered for years with a similar problem before finally being diagnosed with a digestive disorder.  She now eats five small meals daily, has eliminated certain foods from her diet completely  and limits consumption of other foods to a fraction of what she used to eat.  She has been pain and nausea -free for four or five  years.

Medicine is not an exact science.  Generally, a diagnosis is reached either by determining what is NOT going on or on the assumption if X number of people experiencing what you're experiencing have Y disease, then by default that must be what you have.  

Unfortunately, not every ailment is easily diagnosed.  Furthermore, some diseases mimic other diseases so even when you get a diagnosis it can be incorrect.

I realize it is frustrating to continue seeking medical advice, but your best line of defense it to continue to seek help until someone comes up with the right diagnosis.  And if you have not seen an allergist or an endocrinologist, by all means get your daughter to consult one.  It's her body.  She must  i n s i s t  the doctors continue to evaluate her specifics until they figure out what is wrong! 

By offering your situation in this forum, it may be someone will have experienced the same thing and with the information they provide you, you will be armed for the next trip to the doctor.  You are doing all the right things by being PROactive where your daughter's health is concerned.  Hang in there because there IS an answer.  You simply have to continue to search until you find it.",pain in the stomach,,Female,,Her veins colapsed from all the needles./ desparate,no one can figure out what is going on. / pain and vomiting still persist,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Has anyone out there ever gone through this and can you tell me what is going on,,"Yes: First, is your daughter taking any supplements or prescription medications - especially prescription ones? / I had a friend whose daughter suffered for years with a similar problem before finally being diagnosed with a digestive disorder / I realize it is frustrating to continue seeking medical advice, but your best line of defense it to continue to seek help until someone comes up with the right diagnosis.

55,422682,What is the correlation between low-income/poverty and obesity?,"I dont want to sound mean, but why are so many poor people or lower income people so FAT? Is it that they lack money to buy healthly foods or that they lack education about how to live a more healthy life? Does this lead to people believing that people are poor because they are lazy because it is easy to assume that fat people are lazy? Any idiot knows that being overweight is bad for you, so lacking the ivy league education is no excuse. And a plate of salad is just as available and cheap as a big mac, so it comes down to choice. If you look back in history, being fat was associated with WEALTH. Poor people were skinny and under nourished, royalty were fat and happy. Now this trend has reversed.....rich people somehow manage to stay skinny, and poor people get fatter by the moment. Whats going on?","Contrary to most people's opinion it's not the cost of food that's leads to high rates of obesity in low-income people.  It's the lack of education.  Most aren't educated about nutrition which leads to poor food choices.  If you go to your local supermarket and do a price comparison study (which I've done for a research project) you'll find that the cost of fruits, vegetables, whole wheat breads and pastas, and chicken are about equal to the cost of buying the ingredients to make some of these high calorie, low nutritious foods.  Because they lack knowledge about correction portion size, daily fat intake, starches they tend to make poor choices.  Most think a single serving means you eat one plate, which we all know to be incorrect. It also has to do with learned patterns. If they were raised in low income situations most of their recipes come from what they grew up on during a time when underprivileged people didn't really have a much, but found comfort in food.  Which is a Southern tradition big meals replaced expensive living.

65,768616,is wearing flip flops healthy for feet or not? please see my details?,"Hi. Like most girls at 17 I love wearing flip flops all the time but many articles say they are bad for your feet. I don't get it.

The anti-flipflop articles say that b/c flip flops lack arch support your feet may get fallen arches. However many websites that encourage bare feet (which I also do a lot but only indoors) say that going barefoot can HELP strengthen your feet and develop good arches.

See the contradiction? Going barefoot and flip flops both have no arch support but barefoot can ""tone your feet"" and flip flops will ""cause fallen arches"". It makes no sense. I think flip flops is the closest you can get to natural barefoot walking without dirty feet and risk injury/infection. Can someone explain? Thanks!

Oh if you are a girl and age 15-25 please also see my bf's question: http://answers.yahoo.com/question/;_ylt=Au9U2HuU2cmoOTC_5PKlUBsjzKIX?qid=20060618235316AAv8YbX

But you are 17 years old, and your bones are already not soft and forming like a child's.  I don't think you have anything to worry about.

You're not used to eating and you have to start all over like a baby.  Start with a spoon of food, soft food, maybe oatmeal, every 2 hours, and slowly work up to a larger portion.  Eat just soft foods that are easy to digest.  Your electrolyte and hormones are probably way out of sync due to malnutrition so until you are able to eat better, you may have the mood swings and all.  You need to have potassium, maybe mash up or try to eat some bananas.  The bloating is because your body is storing gases and is not used to eating.  You just need to take it slow with small bites much like a baby when they are starting to eat solids.  Drink sips of water, don't try to swig down a glass.  Try an ounce or two with each spoonful of food.  Vary it, use fruit juices too instead of just water.

go tot he doctor if you are still concerned. im sure you can talk tot he nurse and just get the answer over the phone but please prtect yourself!

78,1966769,How much does diabetes impair your lifestyle?,"I'm not trying to offend anyone, but I was just wondering how different your life would be if you are diagnosed.

I'm sorry if this is 25 questions in one, but if you could answer this, it would help a lot.

Does the disease take over your life?
Can you still be active and athletic?
Can you still eat the occasional junkfood?
Does it screw up your sexual life and stuff?
Can you still have kids?
Do the symptoms of the disease go away after you are diagnosed? (ie. Will you still feel thirsty all of the time?)

Can someone tell me the lifestyle differences between Type 1 and Type 2?
I know that they are different, but is one easier to live with than the other?

Will you most likely die from the disease? What will your life expectancy be?

I just want some information on the disease, and I would appreciate it if someone could help me.","My life would be infinitely better if I had not been diagnosed with Type I diabetes at age five. More than anything, I try not to let it control my life or even think about it when I'm not preparing my insulin or testing my blood-sugar. I know I'll pay for that some day, but I would rather live a fuller life now.

I'm not really going mention Type IIs because I don't care; they screwed themselves and are not my problem. Their type is just a lifestyle disorder, not like with Type I, which is a genetic/auto-immune disorder.

Type I diabetics can be active, but we generally don't see the positive gains from such a lifestyle (weight loss, increased energy) than non-diabetics do. 

I eat junk food sometimes, but not high-sugar junk food. Mostly, I like sugar-free, low fat ice cream bars. Yum. Sugar-free pudding is awesome too.

For women, it doesn't serious effect their sexual functioning until pretty late in the game. The trouble is mainly finding a partner who can accept some of the limitations that diabetes places on them, like not wanting to risk a pregnancy. Personally, I would commit suicide before going through the hell of a diabetic pregnancy. I watched a friend's sister going through the worst sort of hell before dying at the end of her pregnancy. Not worth it!

For men, the sexual side effects can be devastating. At some point, they become completely unable to have or maintain an erection. It's much worse for diabetic men with Type II because they are also battling obesity and high blood pressure, much of the time at least.

As for kids, yes, diabetics can still have children; however, if the woman is the effected partner, then she would have to be willing to die or go through the rest of her life blind or with severely damaged kidneys. I'll reiterate: NOT WORTH IT.

Some of the symptoms go away with good control, including the thirst and excessive urination. Good control is almost impossible to maintain without surrendering your entire life to the disease.

Most likely, I will die in my early fifties from complications from the disease. If I had to guess which, I would say from cardio-vascular complications because heart ailments run in my family; I'm double-dipping, so to speak. Of course, I could be hit by a car tomorrow while having a blood-sugar level of 100, because really, no one knows. Each diabetic is different.

I read a research paper not long ago that said the following of diabetes: ""diabetes is one of the most psychologically and behaviorally demanding of chronic medical illnesses"".

Rhythm Method), condom (male and female versions), diaphragm, cervical cap, Spermicides, and/or surgical sterilization. It is recommended that at least two of these be used at once, as they are still not foolproof. If one fails, the other one can help to cover the ""gaps"".

If you are firmly pro-life, do you believe that the abortifacient methods of birth control are wrong?

5,3320418,I have been living with insomnia for the past 20 years.?,"It is getting to the point now where I only get 3 to 4 hours sleep a night. I can not function right anymore, tired all the time. I have tried OTC sleepaids as well as prescription. Doctors also prescribed anti depressants to help me sleep, but all these medications do is make me dizzy, more tired and nauseous all day. I have tried valerian, hot milk, relaxing techniques and tapes, bla bla bla. Nothing works. At this point I am pretty much open to try anything no matter how crazy it sounds. lol (or not).","While I'm sure that JimmyR's links have this, I'll post it here:

I had a bad problem with insomnia for many years, and did some research on it.  Here are the things Iï¿½ve found that help the most.

1.  Don't take the sleeping pills.  Although they are not addictive in the way we tend to think (you won't jones for them if you miss taking them) they are addictive in the sense that once you have taken them for a while, you will have to take them to get to sleep, but they won't have the same effect they used too.   This is because you tend to not get the necessary REM sleep you need to be rested.  If you must take a sleeping pill, take it well before you go to sleep.  For instance, I prefer to take sleeping pills 2 hours before I go to sleep, so that the pill can get into my system and make me drowsy before I get into bed, then get out of my system (hopefully) early enough that I get some normal sleep.

2.  Try to go to bed at about the same time every night.  You have some wiggle room on this, but if you stay out on Saturday night till 3, it'll be harder to go to sleep at 10PM Sunday.

(Which somewhat contradicts:)

3.  If possible, don't go to bed if you're not sleepy.  Note  - one thing I have read and found to be true is that you have to be awake for 12 hours before you can go back to sleep.  So if you sleep till noon, again, you won't be sleepy at 10PM.  

4.  Don't spend more than 15-30 minutes trying to get to sleep.  If you notice that you've been in bed more than 15 minutes, get out of bed and do something for a while.  Make sure what you do isn't going to make you more hyper; e.g. no exercising or energetic music or writing posts to Great Debates (or reading GD for that matter ;) ). 

5.  When you go to bed, choose a chore or some other task that you do not want to do and tell yourself that if you are still awake in thirty minutes you will do that task.  Then, if you are still awake, get up and do your chosen task.  This is my favorite suggestion, as it has worked nearly every time I've used it. .

Those are the most useful suggestions I have.  Other things you can try:

Before you start getting ready for sleep, turn off high energy music and turn the lights down.  I love R&R music, but I went through a period where I had to turn the radio off every night about an hour before I went to bed, or I would be to wired to sleep. And our bodies react to reduced light by producing melatonin which puts us to sleep.  

Get plenty of exercise, but not right before bed.  (Unless you're weird like me - exercise right before bed just puts me to sleep)

Another suggestion that might work is to relax your body, consciously, one area at a time, starting from your feet. You think about the ball of your left foot and relax it, then the ball of your right foot, then the arch of your left foot, etc. You have to concentrate (pretty hard) on what you are doing.

Sex :D  by yourself or with an SO, it produces a nice soporific chemical, which does a nice job of putting you to sleep.",insomnia,,,,Nothing works.,insomnia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,At this point I am pretty much open to try anything no matter how crazy it sounds.,,,,,,Not applicable,,,

14,3682541,"Should a 4 month old be fed water, not liberally, just maybe 2-4 oz per day?","I took a 4-month-old, 13 pounds, 8 ounces, to her pediatrician yesterday with bloody stool.

The pediatrician said there was also a yeast component to the rash.  As I had waited 2 hours in the pediatrician's office, the infant was beginning to be fussy because she was hungry.  I preferred to not give her anymore of the offending formula and instead fed her plain water.  She never gets more than 2 ounces at a time because I do fear for hyponatremia.

44,2945333,What is it?!?,"My boobs are really sore and I'm really grouchy.

I dont know if its the medicine or what? but its making me nuts...My husband cannot stand me either haha! 

this is whats listed for vitex? 
Vitex does not contain natural hormones. It appears to increase progesterone by stimulating luteinizing hormone release from the pituitary gland. Vitex also normalizes excessive prolactin, promoting fertility. 
Female infertility

PMS, especially breast tenderness, cramping, and headaches

Acne, especially if it is related to the menstrual cycle

Fibrocystic breast disease

Heavy menstruation
Side effects are rare. Occasionally, women experience mild digestive upset or minor skin rash. Vitex is not recommended during pregnancy","side effects listed are always the most common ones people get. your medicine may be in fact causing your achy boobs. just because it's not listed, doesnt mean you don't react to it. different medicines have different side effects on different people. we're not all alike!",vitex,,Female,,,,,,,,its making me nuts,boobs are really sore and I'm really grouchy,,,,,,,,,I dont know if its the medicine or what?,boobs are really sore and I'm really grouchy,,,,,,,,,anyone else have any symptoms like this when they were taking it?,,No,,,

I had preeclampsia in my first pregnancy. The BP came down to near normal within a few days of delivery. I also developed it during my second pregnancy, although not as badly. But after the birth, my BP kept going up. They ended up having to keep me an extra couple of days. But my daughter had a significant case of jaundice, so they kept her, too, and we all stayed together.

However, on the mid-right (my right) side of the edge of my tongue, there is a circular patch that is quite a pronounced red, with no coating at all. It is about 1 centimetre in diameter.

My acupuncturist use to tell me which organs were represented by each area but I've forgotten. What interests me most is why this patch doesnt have the white coating?","First off, you may want to go get this checked out by your doctor. First check and see if the white stuff on your tongue can easily be scraped off.  If it can, then it is most likely a candida (yeast) infection.  Any condition in which your immune system drops (such as prolonged used of antibiotics, corticosteriods, or immunocompromising diseases like AIDS, chemotherapy, etc.) can predispose you to this infection. This infection can also cause redness of the tongue without the white coat.  If it is oral candidiasis, also called oral thrush, then antifungal treatment can be prescribed to you by a doctor. Now if the white stuff can not be easily scraped off, then the diagnosis is most likely something called leukoplakia that could be precancerous.  Either way, see a doctor.  You will know what to do if/when this happens again.",virus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,What interests me most is why this patch doesnt have the white coating?,"on the mid-right (my right) side of the edge of my tongue, there is a circular patch that is quite a pronounced red, with no coating at all",,,,,Tongue diagnosis help?,,,,,,Not applicable,,,

32,2205997,Please help!!!! I am trying to understand ADD?,"I think I might have ADD and that I had it my whole life. I did few tests and all of them say I do. At the same time when I read books, I am sometimes not always convinced that this isa seperate Disorder. They say ADD people have a tendency to be addictive, they have low
self-esteem, disorganized, impulsive... That could be anybody with another mental illness.  I mean bipolar, Borderline Personalities.... can also have addictive tendencies, act on impulse, lack judjment... Many so called ""normal"" people are messy, lack organization... I am quite familiar with mental illness since I have few of them. I am just trying to understand when you have ADD, in what way your brain functions differently. What makes it so that you consider this a disorder. I am a bit confused. I would really love to hear from people who have the illness/insiders rather than to try to understand or interpret books on ADD. Please share your own experiences, I already have checked all the ADD websites. Thank you all.","I was diagnosed with AD/HD a few months ago and like you I was skeptical.  I have a few mental illnesses as well so many of the same questions were running around in my mind as well.  I think it's when you have a lot of the symptons.  I know people who are lazy and disorganized but that is because they choose to be.  AD/HD people just can't grab the concept.  We try our best to do it and it's a real struggle.  The one that hit me was the concentration one.  I say ignorance is bliss!  I could do three things at once and easily jump back and forth, if I got distracted I just happily went off to what ever distracted me and came back to what I was doing, if I couldn't remember what I was doing oh well!  After I was diagnosed I was trying really hard to write an email and was concentrating so hard to make sure I got everything in there that I needed too.  The phone kept going off and my YM messenger kept blinking and I was distracted and couldn't remember what I was doing!  It is frustrating when you know you have to try really hard to concentrate and you still can't!!

I realized I self medicated in school and still do! (In college)  I take a big soda with me into classes so I can stay focused.  If I don't have that caffeine I am fidgety and am unable to focus on what I need to.  My mind wonders.

The way I understand it, so far since I am still learning, is that our brains don't have the stimulators that everyone else does, at least not as many, and our minds are searching for outside stimulation to get what it needs.  That's why stimulators such as caffeine and ridolin have the opposite effect they give our brain the stimulation it craves and we are able to focus on what we need to other than it reving us up.

I haven't recieved any medications for AD/HD yet because I'm slightly apprehensive about it making me drowsy and I love the high energy that I have.  I believe that the high energy is just who I am as a person and the AD/HD just adds a little something to it.

I know many AD/HD people are highly creative and they go off their meds when they need to be creative.  I'm also afraid my creativity will suffer from it.

1,4007367,Doctors &/or surgeons please?,"I had a hysterectomy back in July and I know there is still healing going on. I am a surgical asst. so I understand the anatomy and procedure and limitations, but I still have a question. I'm 34, in good health, reason for surgery was uncontrollable bleeding and endometriosis, and pelvic pain. My husband has a large penis and I continue to have painful intercourse. Is it possible that the cervical cuff can not accomidate his size, or is it just part of the healing process?","Although I concur with my colleague, Doc8, that it is entirely possible for you to have remaining endometrial implants, I would disagree that your complaint pattern is suggestive of endometriosis pain.

In a hysterectomy, the uterus, including the cervix, is removed.  The upper edge of the vaginal cuff which remains is sewn shut in a ""purse-string"" fashion.  There is necessarily some loss of length within the canal because of tissue removal and the suture line involving even more tissue.  

The vagina is normally a highly compliant organ, which can stretch by length or diameter without much resistance.  However, after a hysterectomy, the former location of the uterus above the vaginal pouch is occupied by a raw space which fills with fibrous scar.  Scar tissue has a series of phases it goes through and for many many months, it is NOT compliant.  During the maturation phase of this scar tissue, I could easily envision that the normal compliance of your vagina has changed.  Now, there is significant resistance to stretch.

This is, of course, a guess.  However, the time period over which scar tissue matures and softens is well in excess of a year.  If my guess is wrong, then you'll know in about 6 to 12 more months when the problem still hasn't gone away.  

In the mean time, I would humbly suggest that you appeal to the basic principle of country doctoring:  If it hurts, DON'T DO IT! :)

This has really gotten me worried since it has been 1 full day and I'm still suffering from it. Do you think I have a stomach virus or something?","Farmer Girls answer is simplistic and incorrect.  Eating pizza will not give you shivers, dizziness or loss of appetite.  Did you eat the pizza while it was hot?  If not, did you warm it up prior to eating it?
Bacteria grow on pizza as soon as it starts to cool down, generally you've got about 2-3 hours after delivery to enjoy your pizza before you have to nuke it or put in a toaster oven.
This bacteria can cause you to have the symptoms you describe above..they are very similar to the flu.
GI (gastrointestinal upset) occurs when bacteria enter the digestive tract and your body can't handle the toxin.  Your body fights back by trying to expell the bad stuff any way it can.  That's when you see the vomiting and diarrhea.  Your body is ridding itself of the toxin, so it's really a bad idea to take drugs like Immodium.
What you ABSOLUTELY have to do is to keep fluids down.  Drink water primarily, or go to the store and buy some Pedialyte (in the baby aisle)...they are the best things for you if  you are throwing up.
If your vomiting / diarrhea persists or you get dizzy, see your doctor pronto.  Make sure to have someone else drive you if possible.

My question was more of a comment on political correctness. Both are rude, and we live in a country were you can say and do whatever you want, as long as it doesn't impede on the rights of others. If you want to smoke, you should be able to smoke, if you want to eat yourself to death, you have that right too. But lets not pretend that one is better then the other. Really, do you think that the number of people who suffer from these ""conditions"" that cause obesety is all that significant? Instead of making excuses, more people should own up to there faults. I am overweight, I admit it. And, I used to smoke. I am not blaming anyone. It's funny, though. When I told people that I quit smoking, they congratulated me. When I started my diet, They all told me that I wasn't overweight, or not to ""take it too far"". I am 5'8, 195lbs. Anorexia isn't even an issue. No one even thought of the health risks that attributed my being overweight, but everyone thought of the potential of me starving myself to death.

I must tell you that I have a condition called Hyperthyroidism and it is
transitional, that is, that in time that my thyroid 



Will go from hyper and down to normal and than will go to hypothyroid and it
will take its good old time. I cannot eat anything



That has Iodine in it such as certain kinds of fish and shrimp.



I have been looking for something that could help me to get better much
faster but the only thing that I found to be helpful



Has iodine in it and that is forbidden. In your travels have you found
anything that I can take that will help me. Sincerely

If she does get a temp, try a lukewarm bath and a cool rag on the back of the neck and groin area. If she gets a temp 200 or more, u will need to take her to a doctor. If you think it is an allergy, have u fed her any different food or drink that she has never had before? If not, it might just be dust and dander. Get an Oreck air purifier.

18,4148753,Could I have ruptured my eardrum?,"Recently I've had nausea, headache, a cold, and maybe a little bit of tonsilitis for three or four days.  During that time, my ears twinged a bit, but didn't really hurt until last night.  I was relaxing, working on a nice Sudoku puzzle when I tilted my head.  I felt and heard fluid moving somewhere inside my inner ear.  I tilted it at a sharper angle, and it hurt.  That triggered throbbing, aching pain that I couldn't ignore.  Ibuprofen did nothing for it.  It lasted for about two hours, and during that time I paced, watched Law & Order, and tried to sleep, but it just wouldn't go away.  Finally, when my sleeping pills kicked in, I yawned, and something happened.  It popped a little bit, and the fluid moved.  The pain went away.  I moved my head around and it throbbed just a bit, but it was basically gone.  I don't know if any discharge came out because I was under the influence of sleeping pills and went to sleep very shortly afterward.  Could my eardrum have ruptured?","You could have a perforation (a small, tiny hole) in your eardrum which results from pressure withing the middle ear and it is usually called Otitus Media.  If your eardrum burst you would have blood trickling out of your ear as well.  I have had this happen and the pain got so intense, even sleeping pills and/or painkillers didn't help. Up to the point of it bursting, it was incredibly painful.  As soon as it did burst, all the pain went away but there was blood coming out of my ear.  It was actually a relief to me because it was intensely painful and as soon as it burst, I had no earache anymore.  Burst tympanic membranes will heal and you should get some antibiotics to clear up the infection in your middle ear so it doesn't keep happening.  Scar tissue will affect your hearing if it happens too many times.  Hope this helps.

Just a question. I am a 27-year-old woman and I am wondering if this is normal. Whenever I go to bed or say I am napping whether its a 1 hour nap or I am getting up from a nights sleep I have to hobble out of bed until I get moving more--this has been going on for the last couple of months it almost feels kind of like tendonitis in the ankles, however my calves are so tight when I first get up that they hurt to move as well...I mean I am not 18 but I am not old either is this normal you think or is it just from being stiff from sleeping through the night? cause once i get moving around I can walk just fine and stuff. 

just curious--thanks--Jammiegirl","It's true as you get older things start to break down and not work so well.  Weird, sporadic problems- they are so annoying.

But this case is troublesome.  If they are tight and painful, it may be like the other person said here - achilles tendonitis.  You could have injured it or overworked continuously and unknowingly it into a chronic condition.  Of course, day to day activities, normal activities are going to aggravate it.

You may want to try to supplement with a few things.  Firstly, you need something anti-inflammatory that works.  The only anti-inflammatories on the market that I give credence to are plain 'ole aspirin and New Chapter 'Zyflamend' and 'Mycomend'.  Zyflamend is an incredibly strong and advanced herbal formulation that is winning folks over by it's scientifically proven efficacy.  I'd start with low-dose aspirin, use it 3 days on, 3 off. 

Mycomend takes more the Eastern medicine angle with 'time-honored' Chinese medicine and the use of specific mushrooms like reishi and maitake to reduce inflammation.  That's more of a *suggestion* than a recommendation like the aformentioned zyflamend.  

You may also want to supplement with those other joint-supplements like MSM, glucosamine and chondroitin.  I can't speak from experience about those, but people seem to talk a lot about them.

Personally, I would just take additional calcium/mag/zinc and C so your tendons can repair themselves and get lots of sleep and plenty of water.  Also, it helps to believe that these things you are doing are helping you.  Because if you do, they will!

My question is, what is the basic principal of eating as a diabetic?  Is there an amount of protein/carbs/fat that one should eat to maintain a constant glucose level in the blood?  Or a specific timing?  

Thank you so much for your help.","Limit your carb intake. The body turns all carbs into sugar. With simple carbs; sugar, honey, syrup, etc. the body converts these quickly causing your blood sugar to spike so avoid these. Complex carbs like rice, oatmeal, beans, etc. take longer to convert so your blood sugar doesn't spike, but it will still go up. You also have to be careful not to eat too much protein. Protein won't effect your blood sugar, but will effect your kidneys which are already working overtime trying to get rid of the excess sugar. Make an appointment and talk with a dietitian. In the meantime practice portion control. That's where most of us get in trouble. 1/2 Cup is a serving of starch like corn, beans, pasta, potatoes. 1 Cup is a serving of raw veggies and 1/2 Cup cooked veggies = a serving. 1 oz. of meat = 1 serving of meat. Watch your diet and talk with a dietitian and you should be able to control your diabetes without having to go on meds.

1,2500038,What causes a headache in the same spot above an eye?,What could possibly cause this kind of a headache...It's usually in one spot above the right eye. This has been going on for about 9 months now and the headaches come randomly about 3-4 times a week (doesn't seem to be caused because of change in weather). The pain is usually sharp just in that area. Could this be serious or is it just a normal thing to deal with? What can cause this and what can be done to prevent it other then to drink pills?,"Most headaches around the eyes are one of two types - either migraine, or sinus headache; you may be able to determine which one it is likely to be by the following:  

A migraine headache is virtually entirely on one side of the head; it is often accompanied by nausea, and sensitivity to light and/or sound.  Some people experience an ""aura"" shortly before the migraine begins; it can be visual, auditory, or even olfactory (sense of smell).  A migraine is often helped by being in a cool, dark room, and often disappears after a period of sleep.  The causes of migraines are not fully understood, but there are prescription medications that can help; ibuprofen helps some people, but usually it doesn't do much.  Some people also respond to medications or liquids containing caffeine.

Sinus headaches behave differently. Generally, the pain is on both sides of the face, and often worst near the cheekbones or around the eyes.  Light or sound generally have little if any effect on the headache.  Cool surroundings often make the sufferer feel worse; warm compresses or a heating pad often help.  Sinus headaches generally respond well to ibuprofen or Tylenol, particularly if combined with sudafed/pseudoephedrine (like Tylenol Sinus formula or a similar medication). 

If either one of these sounds familiar, then check with your doctor - particularly if it is a migraine, as the only really effective migraine medications are prescription-only preparations.  Even if none of the above sounds familiar, it sounds to me like it's time to see your doctor.

Grading of the symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy is performed according to the so-called West Haven classification system: 

Stage 0 - Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (previously known as subclinical hepatic encephalopathy). Lack of detectable changes in personality or behavior. Minimal changes in memory, concentration, intellectual function, and coordination. Asterixis is absent. 

Stage 1 - Trivial lack of awareness. Shortened attention span. Impaired addition or subtraction. Hypersomnia, insomnia, or inversion of sleep pattern. Euphoria, depression, or irritability. Mild confusion. Slowing of ability to perform mental tasks. Asterixis can be detected. 

Stage 2 - Lethargy or apathy. Disorientation. Inappropriate behavior. Slurred speech. Obvious asterixis. Drowsiness, lethargy, gross deficits in ability to perform mental tasks, obvious personality changes, inappropriate behavior, and intermittent disorientation, usually regarding time. 

Stage 3 - Somnolent but can be aroused, unable to perform mental tasks, disorientation about time and place, marked confusion, amnesia, occasional fits of rage, present but incomprehensible speech

This should have been done initially if you suspected an STD which it does sound like. 
Many doctors in this day and age are beginning to decrease the amount of STD tests done, stupid it know, as they believe the STD epidemic is declining as people become more familiar with safe sex.

Back to your question, has this always happend when you have had sex? No? Then something has obviously developed. Either demand further testing from your doctor or give him/her a sample on the spot. Yes I mean go out and obtain a sample of the gunk on a swab. If you tell the doctor before hand they should be able to give you a pathology swab with a special tube to keep it in. 

Another variation on your symptoms is a blockage of the ducts out of the scrotum, this would cause a blockage and swelling of the vessels giving the illusion your right ball is swallon. Once the body acts to right this wrong the semen would ooze out as it is the only place it can go.

Either way you need to see a specialist if your doctor is being complacent about the issue!

19,1522344,Acne mark/scars?,"I'm not sure what they are called, they're the ugly marks the zits leave behind after they're gone, and it's even harder to get rid of! I have TONS of these on my face, and it's really just bad looking when I look close... (Don't get me wrong, you can clearly see them from a distance too, but it's just uglier close-up).

At the moment, I'm using ProActiv. I admit, it cleared away most pimples (even though I still got one or two every now and then), but I really don't see any changes in the marks. FYI, I've been using ProActiv for about a week, so I may have to wait longer, but I have yet to see any ""dramatic"" results they gauranteed.

If anyone could share some sort of products or methods they use to clear away the marks, it would be much appreciated. They're really ugly.","I know exactly what you are talking about. I'm experiencing the same thing too (they DO look bad from distance or angle), and I'm trying to get rid of them as well. Thing is, I think they're just like any scar you would get anywhere on your body. They'll go away eventually. Proactiv, which I've used (I'm just finishing my second, and last set now) contains a chemical that is bleaching to fabric, and I would assume that same chemical is what'll help fade the marks (though they didn't work for me after the first set, and now finishing my second, they're a bit faded, but still there - keep in mind that everyone's skin is different).

So my suggestion would be to look for other products that are meant for Blemish control/Blemish Fighting. However, if you know that you have sensitive skin, don't use anything else in combination Proactiv. It may cause a reaction. And also, for future reference, within the Proactiv line there is a product called 'Advanced Blemish Treatment'. It works very well if used correctly. You know when you know you're about to get a pimple, and the area gets a bit redish and sore-ish...like the warning sign? If you apply a thin layer of it right then, there's a good chance that the pimple will not even develop, and will leave virtually no mark at all. If you have the funds in order, I would suggest you buy it. It's the only Proactiv product I plan to continue to buy. It costs $33 in Canada.... so whereever you're from, do the math. lol.

But I'm not usually the type of person who gets sick easily, but I've had this stuffy nose for over 6 months and it won't go away.  Towards the end people were tearing out the walls of their homes, and the streets were lined with fiberglass insulation, and I assume asbestos.  My girlfriends parents said they heard a news reporter who was down there talk about how she's had a stuffy nose for months now too.  Has this happened to anyone else who was down there?  And did it go away, or am I doomed to live like this for the rest of my life?","I ended up going to the doctor and getting anti-fungal pills to take.  He ex-rayed my face and there were pockets of stuff in my sinuses.  Everyone I know is complaining of stuffy nose, sinus infection, Katrina cough, sore throats, etc.  You are not doomed. Just get to a doctor and describe what's going on.  Since I took those anti-fungals, I feel much better.  Part of the problem is the mold.  Everything that got wet molded, and with people gutting out their homes, there is all sorts of mold being released into the air.  I wouldn't worry so much about asbestos as the mold.  Also be warned, many of these old houses have layers of lead paint, so lead is also being released.  

This problem will last for quite a while, as a lot of people STILL have not returned to gut their homes.

Another factor for you and others from other areas is the humidity.  If you aren't used to the level of humidity we have here, that could be making you feel even worse.

Before I had health problems I never had any moles, and spent more time in the sun than I do now.

A few people have told me I get them so easily due to having a weakened immune system. Can anyone confirm/give any further information about this suggestion?","It could theoretically be that your weakened immune system is not able to control cancerous growths like it used to.  Under normal circumstances, the immune system patrols the body, looking for cells that are growing out of control, and keeping them in check (usually by killing them completely but sometimes just by controling their growth).  If you are immunosupressed, your immune system can't patrol for these uncontrolled growths as well as it used to.  Moles are a type of uncontrolled cell growth that is usually kept in check by the immune system.  It could be that your immune system is no longer able to stop the growth of these moles and that is why they are suddenly growing.  The best thing you could do is talk to your doctor about them and, even more importantly, keep an eye on them.  Note their number, size, shape, and color, and if anything changes, definitely contact a doctor.  Your immune system plays a very important role in keeping cancer in check, so it's best to keep an eye on it yourself if your immune system can't.

I too, was molested as a child, and it tormented my life for years. Bottom line Friend, when this kind of trauma happens to us, eventually, we all need counselling for it.

I've been told (by my counsellor) that I was fortunate, and that a lot of times we will be either very promiscuous or attracted to same sex.

The symptoms that you have described occur in many diseases or conditions, so it is not safe to say here 'its an STD' or 'its a UTI'.  It does take Cipro a little while to work.  The most important thing is to not stop taking it if you start feeling better.  If you do not take the full course of the antibiotic, the bacteria causing your infection may become immune to it and become harder to kill.  So even if you start feeling better within a couple days, continue the antibiotic as prescribed for the full course, unless you contact your doctor and they tell you otherwise.

Tamitha","Acute pelvic pain is pain that starts over a short period of time anywhere from a few minutes to a few days. This type of pain is often a warning sign that something is wrong and should be evaluated promptly. 
Pelvic pain can be caused by an infection or inflammation. An infection doesn't have to affect the reproductive organs to cause pelvic pain. Pain caused by the bladder, bowel, or appendix can produce pain in the pelvic region; diverticulitis, irritable bowel syndrome, kidney or bladder stones, as well as muscle spasms or strains are some examples of non-reproductive causes of pelvic or lower abdominal pain. Other causes of pelvic pain can include pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), vaginal infections, vaginitis, and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). All of these require a visit to your healthcare provider who will take a medical history, and do a physical exam which may include diagnostic testing. 

Women who have ovarian cysts may experience sharp pain if a cyst leaks fluid or bleeds a little, or more severe, sharp, and continuous pain when a large cyst twists. Fortunately, most small cysts will dissolve without medical intervention after 2 or 3 menstrual cycles; however large cysts and those that don't rectify themselves after a few months may require surgery to remove the cysts. 

An ectopic pregnancy is one that starts outside the uterus, usually in one of the fallopian tubes. Pain caused by an ectopic pregnancy usually starts on one side of the abdomen soon after a missed period, and may include spotting or vaginal bleeding. Ectopic pregnancies can be life-threatening if medical intervention is not sought immediately. The fallopian tubes can burst and cause bleeding in the abdomen, if left untreated. In some cases surgery is required to remove the affected fallopian tube.",pelvic pain?,35-44 years old,Female,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,.anyone have any idea what it might be,,,,,,Not applicable,,,

THANKS","Hello,

I had Ulcerative Colitis & Proctitis six years ago and cured myself without western medications. Proctitis & ulcerative colitis are both serious digestive conditions which affect the colon and bowel. Crohns is a chronic digestive condition which also affects the colon, all of these conditions respond very positively to a process of food elimination.

YES! MEAT !! is a no! no! if you have Crohns why? because meat is extremely hard work for the colon to deal with and so removing meat & meat products from your diet will definately help your colon & condition (symptoms of the Crohns).

41,2193522,HPV vaccine for males?,Recently I heard about a vaccine for many strains of the HPV virus being given to women. I'm wondering about whether this vaccine is available for males as well. Surely cervical cancer caused by HPV is a problem for women but HPV can also cause cancer of the genitals and anus in men as well. Shouldn't this vaccine be given to everyone instead of being just available for women? Is this vaccine experimental or is it proven to be safe and effective? Thank you.,"I agree, the vaccine should be given to males. Males transmit it  too and do on occasion have problems from it. However, at this time it is only approved for females and suggested for girls between the ages of 9- 26 BEFORE they are sexually active. It  is considered effective for certain strains of HPV (16 and 18 are two) for up to 5 years. I guess time will tell if the shots hold up any longer than that.

Clinical trials for Gardasil was performed on girls between the ages of 16-23, therefore they have not tested it in men. The FDA will not approve it for men until it has been tested on them. I believe in time they will work on a vaccine for men, but right now the concern is with high risk strains of the virus that are linked to cervical and genital cancers in women, HPV effects men totally different. There is an extremely rare chance or penile cancer, and anal cancer in men who have anal sex, but overall HPV causes far less problems in men at this time. 
 
I have also heard that the next big thing in HPV is a vaccine of sorts for women that already have the virus, this would be awesome! Maybe men will be considered in the near future too.

12,1274118,"Obesity in todays youth. The parents fault, the schools, or....both?","I think that since some schools are limiting PE to only once a week or removing it all together they are partly to blame.  Some parents buy alot of fatty foods for their kids. Some don't care of their kids spend hours playing video games.  

Kids are like some puppies, they need a lot of exercise to expel that hard earned energy.  You know it's the same energy you fed them for lunch.  

Why do parents deny they are at fault?  The show Honey We are Killing the Kids.  Can anyone say eye opener.  Children spend less the 8 hours at school.  They are at home at least 1/3 of the time, enough for parents to do what they are supposed to.  Raise healthy kids.

His mother is on track getting him away from wheat, refined sugars, Dairy. She should have these confirmed by a Naturopath first however as being allergens, in the majority of cases they are. Other things can be as well such as chocolate and food additives so a proper check is in order.

Asthma also has to do with repressed fear and anger/resentment. I use this technique with resounding success http://www.jentleearthhealing.com/tft.html If you like the look of this treatment then let me know and I will put you in touch with a practitioner near you. In most every case where I deal with this emotional/energetic side as well and release the blockage, there is a very rapid and almost permanent recovery so do NOT underestimate this as being causal and valid. Combining both is the key.

25,1588986,how to increase job/ studies interest in Schizoprenic patients???,"my son who is now 22, developed psychosis symptoms about three years back. since then he has lost interest in Studues/Job. We have tried various options . But for one reason or the other he keeps on aborting the plans.He develops anxiety, as soon as we try to finalize a plan. He has gone thru depressive phase as well. he is on 2mg respideral these days. He was prescribed various other medications in the beginning as well . Presently he is practicaly not doing anything. He also regulary visits Psychiatrist. Her overall assessment is that he is a kind of Schizophrtenic. He also addicterd on Cannabis.
Please advise how can we develop/incease his interest in a job/small business at least.","Tough situation as lack of motivation is a symptom of schizophrenia. It sounds as if he may have a somewhat complex symptom picture including both depression and schizophrenia symptoms. Don't know what he was like before developing symptoms of psychosis, but if he has always tended to be shy, or amotivated then schizophrenia makes these traits more pronounced.

At any rate, it may be that making the jump to a job or studies is too big a jump to make right now. It is also often difficult for you as a parent to be the one who motivates your adult child with a mental illness. I would suggest looking in your community for a community program that would involve your son in some activities that might be a precursor to job/studies. Psychosocial rehabilitation, day treatment, and other rehabilitation programs can be quite helpful. Call your local mental health association, ask your psychiatrist, or call the local mental health center for a referral to a rehabilitation program. 

Hang in there as this is a long-term problem with which you must deal. Ideally you would like to have your child work his way to more independance, but it might be a slow journey. Get some help from people who know how to do this. You might also find out if there is a support group for parents with schizophrenic children--these groups can be very helpful in providing information and support. The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill is an organization that can provide lots of assistance.

30,1588261,People with thyroid problems do not lose wt. same way as others!?,"I've seen some people say that it's all mathmatical/biological. The calories you put in vs. the calories burned. Yes, that works for a NORMAL person. But the people who say that thyroid problem or not, is WRONG. 

Those people need to get more educated about auto-immune diseases. When someone has a thryoid problem such as hypothyroidism (and no, this doesn't happen to ALL of them, but most) is that their metabolism slows or even shuts down almost completely depending on how severe their problem is. No, pills don't aways ""cure"" people and then they drop weight. The more calories resricted for someone with hypothyroidism, the MORE wt. they gain. This has been found over and over again. They need to eat more to speed their metabolism up. Exercise isn't always easy when the thyroid can make you feel as if you just went through chemotherapy. So get educated people! LOL

Who agrees? Disagrees? (be nice) and comment if you like...","I totally agree. While I'm not a person with a thyroid problem I do know several people who have it and it is hard for them to loose weight. Lots of people are quick to jump at the idea that because they (the person with the thyroid problem) can't loose weight that its because they eat to much/ dont exercise. etc. and have very harsh coments towards these people. And that simply isn't true.
I also say (to the uneducated) , get educated before you knock bad comments towards a person with a medical condition...",thyroid problems and weight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The more calories resricted for someone with hypothyroidism, the MORE wt. they gain.",,,,Who agrees?

31,1661446,Could heart disease be causing the intense discomfort in my throat in the morning?,"I was a pack-and-1/2 a day smoker for a decade.  I quit in Aug. '05.  I'm 31yo, I've been doing cardio exercise for months now.  I noticed circulation probs that have become less severe since I quit smoking, but my arms still go to sleep easily while in bed. I also feel short of breath sometimes, when laying down & on the treadmill. The worst symptom is an intense ""pain"" or empty feeling (somewhat hard to describe) emanating from my throat in the early mornings after I urinate, it keeps me from going back to sleep. I think ""angina"" describes this pain, but it's in the throat--not the chest. I used to think this was a withdrawl symptom from nicotine. I used to get it back when I was a smoker; it would go away with my 1st morning cigarette. But as I weened myself off nicotine, first with nicorette gum, then cold turkey since Dec '05, the pains have gotten worse and sometimes persist into early afternoon, not every day but at least several days/week.  I also rarely get satisfying sleep.","It does sound a lot like acid reflux.  You may be supplementing your nicotine urges with food (especially before bed) or just the stress of resisting your urges may be causing some increased acid production.  

Angina is not typically after sleeping or urinating, unless it is ""unstable angina"" which is unpredictable (but not consistently at the same time).  Throat pain can be angina, but usually is accompanied by sweating and shortness of breath and will sometimes radiate down to the chest with a crushing feeling.

As far as the acid reflux part of the equation (not likely Barrett's Esophagus, which is a change in the skin lining the esophagus), you should try taking an acid reducing medication once per day an hour before dinner.  You should also not eat any food at least 2-3 hours before bed, and if possible, you might want to put a phone book under each foot at the head of the bead.  

A couple of medications you can try (over the counter) are Prilosec, Pepcid or Zantac.  Avoid medications like Tums, Pepto, etc, which are short-acting and do not treat the underlying problem.  If your symptoms don't resolve after a week, you will need to have this problem looked at.

You are at significant cardiac risk (because of your other symptoms and history), so you should be getting regular check-ups (twice yearly minimum).  If you experience chest pain on the treadmill, you need to be seen IMMEDIATELY.  I am happy to hear you are exercising, and you should keep it up every day.",heart disease,,,,,,,,"The worst symptom is an intense ""pain"" or empty feeling (somewhat hard to describe) emanating from my throat in the early mornings",t keeps me from going back to sleep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Yes: You are at significant cardiac risk (because of your other symptoms and history), so you should be getting regular check-ups (twice yearly minimum).

32,2364907,Back problems for years and now in trouble again?,"Have had back problems for years with siatica nerve to bulging disc, I will never consent to surgery because when have you heard someone say, ""I had back surgery and it was great!"" You don't hear that. At this point I'm not down in my back, it's just that I know there's bad trouble again because after I've been up a couple of hours my legs hurt from my knees down like their in a cramp and it's almost unbearable. Themn if I sit my feet go to sleep and I night I awake with my arms asleep but I also have 2 bulging disc in my neck. Would like to hear from some people with simular problems. If mine doesn't get better I will be forced to get an MRI and then shots in my back where they put you to sleep and inject steriods to reduce sweeling in the right spot. Any dr that injects without x-ray is wasting his and your time.......","It's good to didn't have any surgeries done - there is a better solution:

Go for a one-time treatment called Atlasprofilax. One of the effects is, that the pressure on the discs is distributed much better - so the bulging disc may recover completely.

Just - the treatment is available in California and Europe only, costing approx. 220 dollars.

44,2466138,"For Bi-Polar II disorder, what seems to help with the severe depressions along with medications?","Hello,
My mother was diagnosed with Bi-polar back in 1993 and has had to be court ordered to take medications following three very sever manic episodes.  This past year was the last, and she was in the hospital for several months.  She has her medications stable again, Lithium, and a couple new ones. This time around she and my dad ended up divorcing as a result, and I have helped her restart a new life on her own.  She is very depressed and I know that doctors don't necessarily recommend anti-depresents with bi-polar disorder.  Is there something to help her from being so depressed?  She has a fear of doctors as well, which doesn't help.  I try to see her as often as I can, but it is very hard to see her so despondent.  She won't take care of herself or her new place.  We have found a program to help with a nurse three times a day and house cleaning.  But it seems as soon as I go away she will resort back to watching tv/sleeping and crying all the time. Any help???",It has been proven that combined treatment of medication and therapy go hand in hand.

Your best bet is to wait until you see the consultant, as only he will be able to ascertain what it is, so chin up in the meantime, If you are thinking of cancer, its far more likely to be something like ibs or colitis, so please dont get yourself all stressed out about it, im sure the consultant will shed some light on it soon for you.  It may be a simple infection, nothing to do with ibs or colitis, its hard to tell with the info you have given.

Dont try and read up too much about things like this, especially with regards your kids, you will find all sort of scary stuff on the net about illnesses, best to put the diagnosis out of your mind until you see the consultant.

I see a lot of scared people every day in my job, and 99% of the time, its nothing serious to worry about. Honest.
