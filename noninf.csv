7,2286054,Why do doctors hand out statins like they are candy to people who don't even have very high cholesterol levels,"One doctor prescribed 4 different statins to my husband over a period of a few years.  Each one caused serious chest pains! He had to go to a cardiologist and get tests to figure to that it was the statins (which cause cardiac and muscle wasting in some people), and he was otherwise very healthy.  Then I had some cholesterol levels that got high after going on Atkins.  My doctor prescribed ""Zetia"" (a drug that is not a statin but has similar side effects) and I also developed some muscle problems that led to an injury and a few months of physical therapy.  Guess what? I figured it out and within 2 days of stopping Zetia, everything was almost back to normal!
Don't tell me that this side-effect is ""rare""!  It's probably present to some extent in a large fraction of the population.  Doctors are handing statins, fosamax and anti-depressants (which I refuse to take) like candy. Go ahead and blame it on the patients if you like.  It's all about the money for some of you.","A doctor will only do what he is trained to do. He is told that these drugs are best for that condition so that is what he prescribes. If you want to blame anybody blame the pharmaceutical companies, they have a bigger control over the teaching of doctors than anybody else. They have the power and influence with the medical community and the government. A large percentage of the people in charge of the FDA retire to the private sector and to jobs with the pharmaceutical companies so why wreck their gravy train.

What is diarrhea?

Diarrhea�loose, watery stools occurring more than three times in one day�is a common problem that usually lasts a day or two and goes away on its own without any special treatment. However, prolonged diarrhea can be a sign of other problems. People with diarrhea may pass more than a quart of stool a day.

Diarrhea can cause dehydration, which means the body lacks enough fluid to function properly. Dehydration is particularly dangerous in children and the elderly, and it must be treated promptly to avoid serious health problems. 

People of all ages can get diarrhea. The average adult has a bout of diarrhea about four times a year.

What causes diarrhea?

Diarrhea may be caused by a temporary problem, like an infection, or a chronic problem, like an intestinal disease. A few of the more common causes of diarrhea are

Bacterial infections. Several types of bacteria, consumed through contaminated food or water, can cause diarrhea. Common culprits include Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, and Escherichia coli. Food poisoning, intestinal fluare known causes.  


Viral infections. Many viruses cause diarrhea, including rotavirus, Norwalk virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and viral hepatitis.


Food intolerances. Some people are unable to digest some component of food, such as lactose, the sugar found in milk.


Parasites. Parasites can enter the body through food or water and settle in the digestive system. Parasites that cause diarrhea include Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica, and Cryptosporidium.


Reaction to medicines, such as antibiotics, blood pressure medications, and antacids containing magnesium.


Intestinal diseases, like inflammatory bowel disease or celiac disease., or Crohn's Disease, 
Whipple Disease; ulcerative colitis,.


Functional bowel disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome, in which the intestines do not work normally. Alcohol and laxative abuse are classified in here.   I'm diagnosed with this.  I'm taking Tagamet for it. No more cramps and diarrhea. 

How Is Diarrhea Treated?

If you have a mild case of diarrhea, you can just let it run its course, or you can treat it with an over-the-counter medicine.Common brand names include Pepto-Bismol, Imodium A-D and Kaopectate, which are available as liquids or tablets. Follow the instructions on the package. 

In addition, you should drink at least six 8-ounce glasses of fluid per day. Choose fruit juice without pulp, broth or soda (without caffeine). Chicken broth (without the fat), tea with honey and sports drinks are also good choices. Instead of drinking liquids with your meals, drink liquids between meals. Drink small amounts of fluids frequently. 

How Can I Relieve Discomfort in the Rectal Area



Some people develop diarrhea after stomach surgery or removal of the gallbladder. The reason may be a change in how quickly food moves through the digestive system after stomach surgery or an increase in bile in the colon that can occur after gallbladder surgery.

In most cases, replacing lost fluid to prevent dehydration is the only treatment necessary. Medicines that stop diarrhea may be helpful in some cases, but they are not recommended for people whose diarrhea is caused by a bacterial infection or parasite�stopping the diarrhea traps the organism in the intestines, prolonging the problem. Instead, doctors usually prescribe antibiotics. Viral causes are either treated with medication or left to run their course, depending on the severity and type of the virus

Now, after i had my son i had to get a biopsy done and i have two areas of abnormal cell growth and if they are left they will eventually turn into cancer. So i now have to go and get a procedure called LEEP done, where they cut the affected areas out. Has anyone ever had this done? If so does it hurt alot? What about afterwards? Need some words of encouragement  please! Thanks",I have had this done.When you go in they will show you a movie about Dysphlasia { not sure if I spelled it rite but you know what i mean}and how they remove it. What will happen if they do not get it all or it comes back.I know that you are scared.I was terrified.But remeber they caught it early which means chances are they will get it all the first time. As for the Leep it's self honestly it's not fun.But they do freeze the effected area before they do it.What I found more uncomfortable was having the freezing needles put in.I had some  cramping after that lasted about 3 days.I just took Motrin for it.

whatever it was,  3 high readings on 3 separate occasions must be there before a diagnosis of hypertension is considered.

believe me, if your pulse is 54 at rest you are very healthy and you dont need any lifestyle modifications. my only advice would be to continue the same and stay away from smoking , alcohol, and drugs.

at such a young age the usual explanation for high blood pressure is secondary , meaning that there is an underlying disease. in that case lifestyle changes are not useful because the underlying condition must be treated.
lifestyle changes are useful for the hypertension that usually comes with middle age .

(white coat hypertension)

its a false rise in blood pressure due to anxiety or fear, its the most common cause of misdiagnosis of hypertension.

ps
i dont know of a relation between bp and psoriasis.
like i said you should get 2 more measurements,and if it is still high, then you will have to think about possible underlying causes,like

kidney vascular abnormality
chronic kidney disease(pyelonephritis)
endocrine problems(pheochromocytoma,thyrotoxicosis)

5,3760952,Heart attack; what are my chances of dieing of a heart attack when i grow up?,"im 16, my father past away feb. 23rd 2006 of a amssive heart attack and my grandma died of a massive heart attack, both on my dad's side...is there any chance i will also have a bad heart when i grow up? i already have medical problems...i have a sleep apnea, a spinal cord problem and many alergies to different things, but most of those don't matter, im just very afraid of having a bad heart....could someone help me possibly?","Dear Bobo:

I think it is very natural to feel worried about a heart attack if one's father has just died of one a couple of months ago. 

Here is my answer:

FIRST: You ARE worried; the question is, SHOULD you be worried? 

The answer is more difficult than just statistics. If you want statistics, cardiac risk, i.e. the risk of a heart attack can be easily calculated:

http://hp2010.nhlbihin.net/atpiii/calculator.asp

But as it states, this calculator, which is used nearly universally by physicians, applies only for those age 20 or greater. Why is that? Because the heart is like pump -- like any mechanical thing, be it one's car or one's sneakers, it wears out over time, and the older one is, the more likely one is have one's heart give out. Since 20 year olds rarely die of heart attacks (i.e. unless you do crack, etc), its not possible to calculate the odds for the ""average"" 16 year old.

SECOND: What IS a heart attack? Generally, it implies a blockage of one of the arteries supplying blood to the heart. The heart, like any muscle, or any machine, requires fuel -- in this case, oxygen, which is supplied to it by the piping called coronary arteries. When these get plugged up, like any pipe, what is needed can't get through. When this happens to living tissue, the tissue dies. In the case of the heart, as it is the main (and only) pump supplying blood to the rest of the body, if the damage is servere enough, then the pump (i.e. heart) completely fails, the entire body is starved of oxygen, and one passes away.

What, then, makes one more likely to have a heart attack? Many things, such as genetics, i.e. a family history of heart disease. But, from this discription, anything that stresses or clogs the piping (arteries) to the heart -- i.e. causes heart disease, also known as atherosclerosis. Stuff like high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes (sugar in the piping, like sugar-water on the table, is sticky and gums up the works), high cholesterol, obesity (which is often a cause of SLEEP APNEA), all increase one's risk.

Generally, when a healthy 16 year old walks into a doctor's office asking, am i at risk for a heart attack, the physician will likely wonder why the patient is asking, rather than being worried about the patient actually being at risk.

Which brings me to YOUR question: ""could somebody help me?"" 

-- the answer I think is: please, please consider talking to a counselor at your school; friends, siblings, a hotline, a doctor. You are worried about your mortality; And right after a family member has died, more so. It's natural, but often, it helps to talk about it. 

Go ask your doctor this question, and see what she or he has to say. It'll be worth it. As for heart disease, see your doctor regularly over the years, listen to their advice, and . . .

Keep well, keep healthy.

I haven't been in a long time and I have had panic attacks and fear-induced shock from visits before, it is really traumatic for me. I am hoping that someone will know a little from having similar experiences.

My Symptoms are: Chest pain, Mussel Spasms(in the chest), soreness in the lungs when drawing a full breath, and difficulty breathing for several minutes after sexual climax. I have also had joint stiffness and pain for many years. Its not old age either, I just turned twenty one in February. I smoked marijuana(first and only time) at a party back in January, and that was around when these problems began.

Thank you in Advance.","I would say you have inflammed cartilidge(since I JUST had that occur to me in the chest area and there is also cartilidge around your joints), but really the best thing for you to do is to have a doctor check you out. I know it isn't what you want to hear, but if you could go with a firend or family member to help your fear or have the doctor give you a house call or just call the doctor's office, it would be much better to get a professional's opinion instead of something from yahoo! :)

Edit: ah yes, the treatment. Well, when I went to the doc's he prescribed some anti-inflammatory (prescription strength since it's the best thing to take). He also told me to ice the chest down when ever possible. 

In order to get the right meds if you need them, a doc has to write a prescription for you, and thus he needs to see you. If you set up an appointment and tell them that you are leery and afraid of coming in they should make your experience very gentle if you decide to go in.","My Symptoms are: Chest pain, Mussel Spasms(in the chest), soreness in the lungs when drawing a full breath, and difficulty breathing for several minutes after sexual climax.",18-24 years old,,,,,,,"I am afraid to go to the doctor and I am hoping that I can self-diagnose and treat without having to go.

EDIT:
I realize how much of a YA! addict I am when I went to my doctor's appt. Friday and asked about your situation and the answer that my doc gave was under no circumstance that a doctor should say anything about a patient gaining weight if they have an eating disorder because this is a battle that they will continue fight as long as they live even if they seem to getting better.
She also stated the weight is really not a big deal and if the doctor was concern about her weight then it he should have ask how is eating habits now? how often does she exercises? things of that nature and decide if he should bring up that continue to make the progress or say for a healthier heart and body you need to cut down on sweets and carbs and exercise more and also never pull out the weight and height chart for a person that has a disorder because in the patient's like you pulling out a magazine in to them and showing a very skinny model and say this is how you suppose to look, this is what the patient hear remember the patient has a distorted view of her weight image.

36,2595940,carboplatin only for ovarian cancer?,"My mom's dr gave her taxol and carboplatin for her first treatment, but for the second he just did carboplatin saying that many european studies say the results are the same if  carboplatin is used alone and not with taxol.  Just wondering if anyone has heard this or if this is the right course to go.  Not too many options though as my mom is without insurance and can't get any financial assistance.","I have copied the following text from the NCI website. This info applies the Stage 3 and 4 ovarian cancer. This is essentially the ""bible"" when it comes to treating cancer. Carbo has been given alone as first line therapy and showed essentially the same overall and progression free survival as carbo/Taxol with less side effects.

Systemic chemotherapy

Since cisplatin was approved in 1979, first-line treatment of ovarian cancer has consisted of this drug being given intravenously or its second-generation analog, carboplatin, being given either alone or in combination with other drugs. Clinical response rates from these drugs regularly exceed 60%, and median time-to-recurrence usually exceeds 1 year in this subset of suboptimally debulked women. Trials by various cooperative groups in the subsequent two decades addressed issues of optimal dose-intensity [15-17] for both cisplatin and carboplatin,[18] schedule, [19] and the equivalent results obtained with either of these platinum drugs, usually in combination with cyclophosphamide.[20] With the introduction of the taxane paclitaxel in the early 1990s, two trials confirmed the superiority of cisplatin combined with paclitaxel to the previous standard of cisplatin plus cyclophosphamide; however, two trials that compared the agent with either cisplatin or carboplatin as a single agent failed to confirm such superiority in all outcome parameters (i.e., response, time-to-progression, and survival) 
Nevertheless, for patients with ovarian cancer, the combination of cisplatin or carboplatin and paclitaxel has been used as the initial treatment (defined as induction chemotherapy) for a number of reasons:

GOG-132 was regarded by many as showing that sequential treatment of cisplatin and paclitaxel was equivalent to the combination because many patients crossed over before progression; moreover, the cisplatin only arm was more toxic because it utilized a 100 mg/m2 dose.[21] 
The Medical Research Council (MRC)-ICON3 study, while having fewer early crossovers, could be interpreted similarly in regard to the impact on survival of sequential treatment.[22] 
Data from MRC-ICON4 have shown a survival advantage for patients treated with the combination treatment regimen versus those treated with single-agent carboplatin upon recurrence (see Table 2). 
In past trials, single-agent platinums were not superior to platinum combined with an alkylating agent; therefore, the explanation of a detrimental effect of cyclophosphamide is unlikely. 
Since the adoption of the platinum-plus-taxane combination as the standard nearly worldwide, clinical trials have demonstrated:

noninferiority for carboplatin plus paclitaxel versus cisplatin plus paclitaxel,[23-25] 
noninferiority for carboplatin plus paclitaxel versus carboplatin plus docetaxel,[26] and
no advantage, but increased toxic effects, by adding epirubicin to the carboplatin plus paclitaxel doublet.[27] 
A study started by the GOG with international collaboration, currently published in abstract form, compared the carboplatin-plus-paclitaxel standard to two carboplatin-containing sequential doublets (one with topotecan and one with gemcitabine) followed by carboplatin plus paclitaxel, and to two triplets including either pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or gemcitabine with the standard doublet. No differences have emerged.[28]

NOW DIE ?","Hi,
I am so sorry that you are going through this.  Unfortunately, I think most people who have chronic medical problems have had similar experiences (I know I have) and of course, I do not think you should give up.  I totally understand wanting to give up because I have felt that way after being treated by incompetent physicians, rude and condescending staff, etc.  But remember, this is your life and you have to try to hang in there with this.  YOU know that your seizures are ""real,"" it's just going to be a question of getting to the right person.  I know you feel like you've tried and tried, but it might just be the next doctor you talk to.  

I know you are upset and I don't exactly understand what you are saying, but most (good) psychiatrists know that many of the medications that they give can cause symptoms like seizures and tremors, etc.  It seems like they should be able to clearly see what you are saying (as I understand it):  you were misdiagnosed with a mental illness, given medication which caused temporal lobe epilepsy and that now temporal lobe epilepsy is your ""main"" diagnosis; not the mental illness.  I hope I'm understanding you properly.

Your situation sounds so stressful, I don't even know where to start with how to help you.  For example, I think you could be helped SO much by a support group for people with epilepsy/seizures.  You are probably already familiar with the epilepsy foundation.  I put the link below.  They have a place on there where you can locate support in your area.  Then, maybe at the support group, you may find someone who thinks they have the greatest, most caring neurologist in the world and you could try to see that person.

I'm thinking that maybe when these physicians see your chart and see all of the mental health diagnoses, they are, like you said, ""writing you off"" to a degree - it does still happen unfortunately.  You've probably already done this, but in the visit, I would bring my films (x-rays/ C.T.'s, etc.) and whatever documentation you have that you have temporal lobe epilepsy as your primary diagnosis.

In the broad scheme of things, it probably doesn't really matter if they are treating you for a mental illness or for the epilepsy as long as you get the treatment you need.  Like I said, a psychiatrist COULD be the right person for the job.  I don't know.

I guess I don't have any answers, but I wanted to reach out to you mainly to tell you to get some rest, maybe take a little break from doctors (I do that some times) and then maybe things will look a little more optimistic to you.

I couldn't tell from your question if you were just very frustrated and were saying, ""now die?"" or if you really meant it.  Because I am a social worker, I need to make sure that if any time you feel like you might hurt yourself or someone else, you should either go to the emergency room and/or call the 24-hour crisis line where you live.  I put a link to the national suicide/crisis hotline below.  Calling either of these numbers DOES NOT MEAN that you are crazy or suicidal.  It means you need someone to talk to about your frustrations; someone who won't judge you and who will help you get through the night.

Please take care of yourself.  I wish you all the best...",mental illness,,,,how long should i keep this going?/ should i quit/ just roll over and die?ENOUGH'S ENOUGH ALREADY?,mental illness,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, i was told i had no psych background there why have i been placed on meds that, mental illness,"  i don't think i would be fighting so hard to clear thi up if they would have nailed it down by now, all i foun out if that the drugs i was given had produced the symptoms they were looking for.

Is it possible to get a referal from your existing GP and psychiatrist and book a visit with them before you move? You don't say how far out of area, so perhaps a few overlapping visits each way would get you into a comfort zone. Definitely consider a visit back to the old ones after your move, just so that you can talk about how your fitting in... its worth a trip right across country if it means your mental health.
You could try the same with church, promise yourself a trip back after 3 months, which will give you something to look forward to.. and in the meantime you can explore a couple in the new area. 
Something that could help in your new area if you are able, is to have a dog, or cat.. Both are excelant therapy and a dog especially will give you a rewason to get out and about and a chance to meet the locals in your area. 
If your a reader, joining a book club will also give you a low key way to meet new people, or doing any simple course at the local night school... doesn't have to be achademic.. wine tasting, language, play acting are all fun things to do for a term, and give you an opportunity to interact with other people with time on their hands.

In some women the symphisis pubis can actually separate, and this is very painful. A supportive belt may help with this - check with your doctor.

As for stripping your membranes... You as a patient have a right to refuse any treatment and the doctor must respect that; however, the doctor can choose not to honor your request for a treatment that he/she deems inadvisable.

Stripping your membranes is likely to stimulate labor if you are really on the verge of going into labor anyway; at 38 1/2 weeks, that may be unlikely. It can also increase your risk of infection and of premature rupture of membranes, either of which could cause all kinds of problems.

They put her on prednisone (steroid) a yr ago at a high dose and the symptoms got better right away.

109,1360556,hemorrhoids  and blood poisoning?,"Another weird question I can't find an answer for on any website:
A lot of people have hemorrhoids bad enough that they will bleed when they go to the bathroom. 
Now, this means that fecal matter passes by a wound, an opening in a vein. The fecal matter is alive with bacteria that can, if they get into your system, cause all kinds of conditions. Yet I have never heard of people getting sick. Wouldn't you expect something like blood poisoning to happen? Feces and open, bleeding wounds aren't supposed to mix well. 
I am obviously missing something here, but I just can't figure it out. Statistically, you just would have to expect people to infect themselves occasionally.","You make a very good point. One of the most common bacteria in the digestive tract is E. Coli. People get food poisoning from this, so logically a bleeding hemorrhoid or fissure should cause blood poisoning, but like you, I have never heard of this happening. I can only speculate as to why this is, but blood is nature's way of cleaning a wound. Perhaps since the hemorrhoid is actively bleeding during a bowel movement it keeps the wound clean and doesn't allow the bacteria to enter the blood vessel. Also the body is remarkably resilient and I would assume that if you had a tear or hemorrhoid, the bodies natural defenses would ""kick in"" increasing the number of white blood cells to destroy any bacteria that did manage to get into the system. It is definitely something to consider.",hemorrhoids  and blood poisoning,,,,,,,,Wouldn't you expect something like blood poisoning to happen?,hemorrhoids  and blood poisoning,,,,,A lot of people have hemorrhoids bad enough that they will bleed when they go to the bathroom. ,hemorrhoids  and blood poisoning,,,,,"I am obviously missing something here, but I just can't figure it out.",hemorrhoids  and blood poisoning,,,,,,"Yes: I am obviously missing something here, but I just can't figure it out.

I have very low blood pressure, anaemia  and before anyone says eat this and eat that, I have always had low blood pressure, anaemia and constantly (seasonal), have sinus attacks.. So much so I had to have x2 operations to clear the right and the left sinus passages.  etc, etc.

I have always had to take iron tablets, which combat the dizzy and tired feelings.  The minute I do not take the tablets, and monthly vitamin B injections, I start the dizzy / tired feelings again.  

By the way, are you a small lady.  I am 41kg and 5ft3"".  Small lady's are most likely to suffer from low blood pressure.  You must also take an extremely good vitamin tablet and caltrate plus for your bones etc.  DAILY.

and,  having sinusitus (chronic) leaves you feeling ""drunk"", lightheaded, because of all the congestion.  Big worry is when your nose (the gooeeeeeyyyy stuff inside) cannot be ""blown"" out.
You need to get homeopathic drops to be taken daily, called Sambuccus Comp. Drops ""Weleda"".  I don""t know if you can get this where you are.  I use it daily.   It definately relieves your sinus, and relieves the dizzy, vertigo feeling.  If it does not you must be referred to an ear, nose and throat specialist by your doctor.

As far as the recovery and effectiveness of the operation is concerned, talk to your doctor and tell him/her complete history. It is important because (s)he is the only person who can give you best advice based on your case about the effectiveness of the operation or go for some other treatment.

145,3566905,What should I do? I'm perfectly healthy all this time then all of a sudden...?,"I went to the doctor to see if there was something I could do about the fact that I bruise easy. I've always bruised easy, since I can remember, I'm just more concerned now that I'm older and people think that I'm abused. So I go to the doc and they do all kinds of blood work and then the doc said the nurse was concerned about my heart rate (46) so they did an EKG and sent me on my way and said they would send the results to me in a week or two. Yesterday I got a message on my answering machine, the doctor  had scheduled a echo cardio gram (heart ultrasound) for friday. The doc didn't even call me to tell me anything. I've been trying to call the doctors office all day and the receptionist keeps giving me the nurses voice mail. I never had any problems before. Why wouldn't they call before scheduling something like that or atleast tell me why. My Dad said not to go for the test until they tell me why they want to give it in the first place.","My personal opinion is I would go for the test and ask them then.  I would also continue to call.  Did you leave a message with the nurse?  I think if the doctor scheduled for this test it must be important and it would be silly to no go because he didn't call you personally.  If you don't like the way they are handling your case after the test, take the test results to another doctor and get a second opinion.  I hope it all turns out alright.  Good Luck!

Sometimes doctors forget there a faces beyond the tests they are looking at and don't always have the best bedside manner.  Unfortunately some of the best doctors out there seem to have the worst bed side manners. When you call express your concerns to the nurse they will usually listen to you and help you get the information you need.

Let us know how you are doing!

157,1887825,"Do I have an arrhythmia, nervous system problem?","Six weeks ago I had a tachy brought on by lack of sleep (50 hrs) and taking in tons of caffeine (1600mg in 12 hrs).  I have been to tons of doctors, cardiologists, oncologists and have been through tons of tests.  The only thing they have found so far is a slight mitral valve leak.  This could not be causing my heart rate to jump from 60-65 at rest to 100-110 as soon as I stand up.  My heart races with minimal physical exertion and all they found with all these tests was a slight valve leak?  I bought a $50 heart rate monitor and found the 40 to 50 beat jump on my own.  I have told every doctor I have seen about this before testing it on my own and none of them has been concerned about it.  They are telling me that I am in perfect health and do not have an arrhythmia.  Could I have messed up my nervous system?  When my heart started beating really fast I thought I was having a heart attack and panicked.  I have read that going through trauma like that can cause this.  Thoughts?","You mention that you have seen several doctors and had several tests, but have you been to a Electrophysiologist ? This is a cardiologist who only specializes in diseases and disorders relating to arithmia's.While there may be several causes to your symptoms sometimes the only way to find out difinitavly what may be causing these fluxuations in your heart rate are two tests,one is what they simply call a tilt table test.simply put they strap you down to a table (only so you won't fall) and they monitor your vitals laying completly flat and start to tilt the table both forward and backwards (as if they were tipping you up side down)this is often done when your sypmtoms are caused when you go from sitting to standing.this could be caused also by a sudden drop in blood pressure from standing,the other test is is a Electrophysiology (E.P. Study)
The procedure involves inserting a catheter  a narrow, flexible tube  attached to electricitymonitoring electrodes, into a blood vessel, often through a site in the groin or neck, and winding the catheter wire up into the heart. The journey from entry point to heart muscle is navigated by images created by a fluoroscope, an x-ray-like machine that provides continuous, live images of the catheter and heart muscle. Once the catheter reaches the heart, electrodes at its tip gather data and a variety of electrical measurements are made. These data pinpoint the location of the faulty electrical site. During this electrical mapping, the cardiac arrhythmia specialist, an electrophysiologist, may instigate, through pacing (the use of tiny electrical impulses), some of the very arrhythmias that are the crux of the problem. The events are safe, given the range of experts and resources close at hand and are necessary to ensure the precise location of the problematic tissue.

Once the damaged site or sites are confirmed, the specialist may administer different medications or electrical impulses to determine their ability to halt the arrhythmia and restore normal heart rhythm. Based on this data, as well as information garnered before the study, sometimes the specialist will proceed to place an implantable cardioverter device (ICD) or a pacemaker or will perform radiofrequency ablation. In any case, the information proves useful for diagnosis and treatment.

Throughout the procedure, the patient is sedated but awake and remains still. Patients rarely report pain, more often describing what they feel as discomfort. Some watch the procedure on monitors and occasionally ask questions. Others sleep. The procedure usually takes about two hours. The patient remains still for four to six hours afterward to ensure the entry point incision begins to heal properly. Once mobile again, patients may feel stiff and achy from lying still for hours. 

I have several arythmia disorders that i was born with and have been through these tests litterally over 50 times in my life,and while it may sound scary and painful it isn't ,you will receive sedation and pain medicine.Plus the info they can learn from these procedures in some instances can be life saving.Now i'm not saying you may have something life threatning.it may very well be something as simple as anxiety related but if it is bothersome enough that it scares you as much as it seems to i think i would see one of these doctors just to be on the safe side.","arrhythmia, nervous system problem",,,,,,,,When my heart started beating really fast I thought I was having a heart attack and panicked.,my heart started beating really fast,,,,,,,,,,,,, I have told every doctor I have seen about this before testing it on my own and none of them has been concerned about it.

168,620863,Does anyone know anything about LCPD or Legg Calve  Perthes Disease?,"We were told my 3 year old grandson has it almost a year ago and that his bone to his hip is completely dead and all we could do was watch him and do x-rays to watch for changes. 2 weeks ago after the x-rays he told us to cut his activities back and give him Motrin 2 to 3 times a day. No jumping, climbing,kicking, sliding or any kind of playground activities.This will be for years. He said this is the beginning of the critical time for him. I know this disease is rare and I just wonder if there are many people out there with kids this young and how do you deal with with slowing them down. We have adopted him and he is a little 100% boy always climbing and running and it is so hard to get him to slow down. He does not understand that it will hurt him. If anyone knows anything about this disease I would like to hear from you. Thank  You..","Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease (aseptic or avascular necrosis of the femoral head)

Avascular necrosis occurs when the bone that makes up the ball portion of the hip is damaged from lack of blood supply. The reasons this occurs are not clear. Since a higher incidence of this disorder is noted in several dog breeds, including terrier breeds, miniature pinscher, poodles and possibly schipperkes, it is assumed that there may be a genetic component to the problem. In Manchester terriers, the genetic component appears to be a strong influence and heritability is pretty high for this problem.

Most of the time the clinical signs of this disease occur in 4 to 11 month old dogs and usually consist of lameness of one leg only. Pain may be mild to very severe. Some dogs have mild forms of this condition and do not require medical care. In other dogs, the condition cause sufficient pain and deformity of the hip joint to require surgical intervention. The disorder can usually be confirmed with X-rays. Atrophy of the muscles of the affected leg is not uncommon. If this is severe it can slow the recovery period considerably and may make medical therapy less likely to work.

Treatment of this condition varies according to the severity of the signs seen. In mild cases, enforced rest may be sufficient to allow healing of the damaged areas to occur. In some cases, immobilization of the affected limb using an Ehmer sling may be beneficial to recovery. Many dogs have advanced cases of this disease by the time they are examined by a veterinarian and medical treatment is not likely to work. In these dogs, excision of the femoral head (ball portion of the hip joint) is often beneficial. Removal of this section of the bone diminishes painful bony contact in the hip joint. Recovery from this surgery can be slow with recovery periods of up to one year sometimes occurring before good use of the affected leg returns. If muscle atrophy is not present at the time of surgery the recovery time is usually much less. Pain relief and anti-inflammatory medications may be beneficial.

There is a stronger tendency to treat this as a medical condition prior to surgery right now. A general rule of thumb is to allow non-surgical therapy a month to show a beneficial response. If one is not seen, surgical repair should be considered more carefully.",LCPD or Legg Calve  Perthes Disease,,,,,,,,He said this is the beginning of the critical time for him.,LCPD or Legg Calve  Perthes Disease,,,,,,,,,,,I just wonder if there are many people out there with kids this young and how do you deal with with slowing them down.

I have a three year old and I can't imagine her going through life without siblings. IVF shouldn't be necssicary if I have concived and have a child. I have alson had two miscarriages in the past two years not related to the blocked tubes.This is really bothering me can I get some advice?","IVF (in vitro fertilization) treatment; IUI, ICSI and Laparoscopic surgery is very cheap in India. The cost is very low and the medical services are very good in India.

My cousin and her husband got their IVF treatment in India through the Forerunners Healthcare in India and is all praise for this company. She is a known case of PCOS.She is a very happy mother of a baby boy now. She just paid 2500 pounds for the full IVF treatment in India for which she was quoted 8000 pounds in private setup in UK.

Forerunners Healthcare is very famous in India. I read a lot about them in the newspapers. I have also read about a Chinese couple who planned surrogacy through the Forerunners Healthcare. They arrange financing for USA, Canadian, UK and other international patients who plan to have surgery and infertility treatment like IVF, IUI, and ICSI abroad for low price. They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. There are huge cost savings. As a doctor I personally believe that surgery and treatment  can be easily handled in India, as the quality of healthcare available In India is simply best in the world. The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star.

You cannot cut down a tree by cutting off its branches, you have to go for its trunk and its root. Sometimes we only cut branches, sometimes we cut off the trunk, but if you don't take out the roots, the tree always grows back.

The obvious suggestion is to go see a therapist. However, that alone will not do it. It is important to seek outside support, bulimia groups and family support are important. If family is not an option, seek friends. The more shame you have, the more you will hide it and feed into the disease.

It is possible to die from an infection like this, but those are extreme cases. The only way to take care of your problem is to see a Dentist, have a radiograph, and exam.

33,3964269,Does anyone have advice for a person considering a relationship with someone with Herpes HSV I II?,"I am having a difficult time getting comfortable with the fact that my girlfriend has HSV I and II(and I do not).  I am afraid, knowing that if I choose to stay in this relationship, I will eventually end up getting it as well...and there is no way to know how my body will react to the virus'.  Right now I am viewing the virus as a magnifying glass that makes small concerns seem like larger ones, because it is a huge commitment just to try to see if the relationship will be successful.  The relationship would already have more than normal amounts of stressors because of geographical issues(I'd have to move a long distance to be with her) and other reasons.

I was in a similar situation as you and knowing that my girlfiend had HSV 2 I decided to stay with her.   I used a condom for several months and never got it.  Recenlty we got engaged and have been having unprotected sex.  I now have the HSV 2 virus and to be honest with you, I really never ever think about it.  I honestly don't see what the big deal is. I get an OB maybe once very 3-4 months the size of a pea on my inner thigh....I put a bandaid on it, take medicine and it's gone in a couple of days.   It doesn't affect my life in any way and I feel like the luckiest person alive for having my fiance.  I would have done the same thing 1000 times over again.  So I guess the question you have to ask yourself is...  do you love her and can you see yourself being with her forever....if so,  I think the answer is very simple.  If not, but you think the relationship has potential to be something great then you just have to be careful.   The last thing I would do would be to not be with her because of this despite how you feel about her.      By the way,  you aren't a bad person for feeling this way.

It came back postive as soon as I urinated on it. (The hospital says they gave me one but it came back negative.)That thursday I went to the hospital again & they did 2 ultrasounds & she said she didnt see a baby but that I had a cyst on my right ovary.I then went 2 my ob-gyn & she gave me a test & came back positive.She also did 2 ultrasounds & found a cyst on my left ovary too.She said she didnt see the baby but that it could be to early.She sent me straight to the hospital 4 emergency surgery bcause the cysts had ruptured.During the surgery she noticed that I was pregnant in my right tube that had also ruptured & removed half of it.I almost died because of all the blood loss.Shouldn't they have done somethin different to me.He didnt even touch my stomoch!,"I'm very sorry that you had to go through that.  It is possible that they did a pregnancy test and it was negative because that can happen with a tubal pregnancy.

It sounds like you are obsessing with your weight. I used to think I was fat too because my oldest brother used to tell me that. I was a wiry lil thing and didn't even know it. 

You are depriving yourself of needed nutrients. Two bowls of cereal is not going to get you anywhere and then you turn around after eating fast food and you starve for two days. Think about it...does that sound normal to you?

You probably feel like crap and don't even know it. 

You need somebody that can help you cope with whatever it is that you need to cope with. They will help put you on a diet that will be good for you. Teach you how to eat proper portions and go on healthy excercises that will keep you from gaining weight.

You seem to know quite a bit about it yourself.  The main criteria are

1.  Qualtitative impairment in social funcioning   -   this is not the same thing as not enjoying social encounters, which is much more likely to stem from potential issues caused by bullying.  If you can respond to emotional cues from other etc., have developed peer relationships and you gain enjoyment from interactions (at least sometimes) then you're probably OK.

2.  Restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behaviour/interest/activitiy  -  do you have these?  You didn't mention any so I assume the answer is no.  They would include a pre-occupation with parts of objects or non-cunctional routines or rituals.

3.  Clinically significant impairment in social or occupational (employment) functioning  -   can you hold down a job?  Maintain relationships?

People with Asperger's also show a delay in self-help, adaptive behaviour and curiosity, so the fact you've asked a question here in itself is a good sign.

You sound totally normal and I think you should basically ignore the poster who said you should be concerned.

68,1049932,Is it a seizure?,"My 13 year old daughter started having ""episodes"" (for the lack of a better word) about 6 months ago. She has had 3 this week though and I am scared. She is having severe chest pain with pain running down the left arm (she says like a throbbing pain), trouble beathing; like she is choking, and she passes out. When this happens she is pretty much out for 30-45 minutes. Afterward she is fine with no visible side effects. Upon taking her to the emergency room and running of tests doctors have found no cause. She is set to see a neurologist next week. Before this week she had only had 3 of these episodes total; but 3 in one week really scares me. I have not seen any common thread or trigger of these episodes.","Although I would not want to guess what is actually the problem, it doesn't sound like a seizure, at least not an epileptic seizure of any sort.  A grand mal seizure is characterized by the uncontrolled jerking and ""seizing"" of the entire body that one usually thinks of as a seizure.  There isn't usually any pain associated with it prior to the onset, although some people do report an aura of lights or such just before it happens.  After the seizure passes, the person regains control and consciousness, but they are extremely tired and sleepy, and sometimes disoriented. In petit mal seizures there is a sort of ""checking out"", usually the person stares off into space for several minutes, and comes back without realizing much has happened. There are variations, but none of them involve pain, breathing difficulties, or passing out in that sense.  So while whatever is wrong is definitely in need of being further evaluated, I would say that epilepsy is not one of the things to be a concern.
  The neurologist will likely order an MRI, CAT Scan, and several other neurological tests, along with some cardiac testing to eliminate that as a possible cause.  Until those results are all in, he likely won't be able to give you many answers.  In the meantime, though, you can ask him what sort of precautions you should take to keep her safe.  I'd imagine they wouldn't want her doing anything really physically demanding, sports or anything like that.   Hopefully you can get the answers you need fairly soon, and be able to put your mind at ease.  I'm sorry I can't offer more help than this.  While I can tell you it doesn't sound like any form of seizure I've ever seen or been taught about, I certainly wouldn't be of any help in guessing what else it might be.",seizure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,She is set to see a neurologist next week.,see a neurologist,,,,,,,,but 3 in one week really scares me.

I have 2 small children, a job, and laundry! I do not have 7-10 days to spare!!!! So, I followed this regimen and immediately began to feel better. Took my antibiotic as prescribed. Every 2 hours, I gargled with warm salt water, drank a full glass of lukewarm water (didn't want to upset my stomach), and did a ""steam treatment"" on my sinuses. Basically, I got a kitchen towel, soaked it in hot, steamy water, and without wringing it out, placed it over my mouth and nose and breathed in the warm steam. I also placed Vicks vapor rub over my chest and throat and slept with a warm heating pad over my chest while I got lots of rest!!!! I also added Mucinex which worked wonderfully.

Thank you.","Polycysitic ovaries, or PCOS is a complex condition that to this day has no clear cut situations. But first as off let me address your possibilities of not being able to fall pregnant. This is not always the case. Your presonal situation will be different to every other woman with PSOC, so this is something only you and your doctor can discuss, however, more and more women who suffer from PCOS are falling pregnant. If you are in a relationship and are looking ot fall pregnant, then there are many things medically that can be done to assist, however some women dont need assistance at all.

Secondly, a Laparoscopy is a procedure that uses a ""laparoscope"" via a key hole inscision to send a camera to your ovaries to have a look.  Your Doctor may or may not remove cysts that he sees, as depending of the size and the nature of the cyst, they can often disappear over time. If he does chose to remove the cyst, it generally can be done through the same key hole inscision. 

Also, ovarian drilling, done during laparoscopy, is a procedure in which a laser fibre or electrosurgical needle punctures the ovary 4 to 10 times. This treatment results in a dramatic lowering of male hormones within days and is often performed in women who have polycystic ovary syndrome. Studies have shown that up to 80 percent of patients will benefit from such treatment.

One thing I wish to say to you is never follow 'things you have heard' as gospel for your own health. Only a health professional who knows your medical history should make calls on your personal situation. 

But I do suggest that you read health journals, or even go to www.soulcysters.com It is a support group for women with PCOS and can be a valuable resource for information.

Good Luck, and your situation isnt as uncommon as you may believe and all you have to do is ask a few other woman, and chances are, one of them will have PCOS too.",ovarian laparoscopy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I heard that if I develop scar tissue, I will not be able to get pregnant.",not be able to get pregnant.,I'm confused about an ovarian laparoscopy.,ovarian laparoscopy,,,,,, What are the chances that I will be scarred?,,,,,"Yes: But I do suggest that you read health journals, or even go to www.soulcysters.com It is a support group for women with PCOS and can be a valuable resource for information.

I had to reply to you straight away, as I am 25 too, and two years ago had my 1st mild dyskaryosis smear result. I went back 6 months later. (It can clear up by the way, which is why they call you back in 6 months.) Mine did not. The 2nd smear also showed mild dyskaryosis. HPV was not tested for at this smear. I then had a colposcopy, which is not that bad. I went back again and was told that the biopsy showed moderate to severe dyskaryosis with HPV, so it was worse than I thought. Everyone's treatment varies. I was very lucky, as although the grading of mine usually calls for the loop excision, I was offered cryotherapy as the area affected was so small.

Apparently, once treated, problems rarely reoccur, but obviously, they keep a check on you. After my treatment, I went back 6 months later, then six months after that for smears. Both were clear and I now have to go every year for the next nine years to make sure.

I must say to you though, I HATE going for smears. I used to faint every time. Nearly fainted after the colposcopy too. So I was petrified. Now, I look back and think I was lucky compared to many, and we are lucky to have such a system in our country where they do check these things.

Any hopefull suggestions?","It sounds like you are not thinking about solving one problem at a time, but focussing on them all at once, which can be stressful, overwhelming, and can worsen your depression. Here are some things you can try at home to decrease your depression. Hope this helps.

""GET OUT OF BED: 

One of the most important things you can do is get up at about the same time every morning (even week-ends). Preferably, that means about 7 a.m. or earlier. You might not feel like it but Get Up. Such regularity helps your body function more normally so you're more likely to feel normal. 

LIGHTS: 

Light helps your body function better. So turn on a lot of lights as soon as you arise. Open curtains to get more sunlight. Better yet, go outdoors into the sunshine as soon as you can. Remove any eyewear so light will enter more readily (glass cuts out some of the sun's rays). But don't stare at the sun, of course. 

MOVE: 

Be active right away -- oxygenate! That means getting up and walking around your dwelling for five or 10 minutes, or perhaps riding an exercycle. Mild exercise gets the blood flowing and transports more oxygen throughout your body (especially to your brain), helping you feel mentally alert and alive. 

MUSIC: 

Select and play some energetic, happy music as you dress and have your breakfast. The audiovisual department of most libraries has albums and tapes you can check out. 
  

BREAKFAST: 

Begin your breakfast with protein (i.e., meat, eggs, peanut butter, nuts, cheese). When you get up, your body chemistry is ready to convert food, especially protein,into longlasting energy. To balance your most important meal of the day, add an orange or other fresh fruit and whole grain cereal or whole grain bread. 

TALK WITH SOMEONE: 

One of the quickest ways to beat the blues is to interact with others. You might not feel like doing that - you'd rather avoid people when blue. So make lt easier on yourself. Talk with someone you enjoy about a subject you enjoy so there is definite give and take. 

And, force yourself to say ""hello"" to the persons next to you in class, those where you live, anyone around. 

LIMIT CAFFEINE: 

The long-term (four hours or so) effects of caffeine are depression. Try to limit coffee to no more than one cup in the morning. Coffee can make you more alert for an hour or so, but later you get an opposite reaction. Caffeine tends to increase the release of insulin in the blood, and insulin lowers the blood sugar level. When you have low blood sugar levels, you begin to feel less sure of yourself, and have low energy levels, which can lead to the blues or depression. 

LIMIT SUGAR: 

Sugar might give you an initial rush of energy, but within an hour or so the blood sugar level can become low, and when it's low you may feel low, too. 

The caffeine/sugar cycle. It's easy to get caught in the caffeine and sugar cycle -- having coffee, caffeinated soft drinks, or something with sugar every two hours or so to ""stay up."" For example, cola contains about 10 teaspoons of sugar plus caffeine equal to about half a cup of coffee. In addition to bringing on the blues, this cycle can result in dependence, poor nutrition. and obesity -- reasons to get down on yourself even more and feel blue. 

MAINTAIN FIBER: 

Fiber helps food go through your digestive system at a proper rate, giving a more constant energy supply. Highly processed foods merely provide a quick surge of energy which can be followed by depression. You can maintain fiber in your diet by eating an orange or grapefruit rather than just drinking the juice. Eat fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, and whole grain breads and cereals. 

STRESS B COMPLEX: 

Some persons report receiving help by taking a concentrated vitamin B complex. You'll find these called something like ""Stress B"" or ""B 50."" This is controversial.

Plz ask your doctor to do these basic tests, I dont know why the CT Scan is such an abused test! Instead of doing the routine basic investigations they jump to the more hi falutin ones!

These would be the tests required to find out the root cause of your problem. Till then anything is just speculation:

-Blood tests such as CBC, electrolytes, thyroid function tests, and vitamin B-12 levels
-Imaging studies like a CT scan of the head, CT scan of the spine, MRI of the head, or MRI of the spine
-Electromyography to measure how your muscles respond to nerve stimulation
-X-ray of the affected area
-Lumbar puncture to assess for multiple sclerosis and other conditions
-Ultrasound of neck vessels to evaluate your risk for TIA or stroke

42,780455,"Which is the bigger problem?  Obesity, or aneorexia?","Apparently the pressure is on young women everywhere that they have to be as skinny as inhumanly possible to be sexy, but end up being undesirable because they just end up looking dead.  Conversely, being fat is also nothing to be ashamed about, because most of it is ""genetic"" anyway, and there's no point in trying to change who you are (even if that means succumbing to diabetes).  Which is worse; being too skinny or being too fat?","Today, 64.5 percent of adult Americans (about 127 million) are categorized as being overweight or obese. Each year, obesity causes at least 300,000 excess deaths in the U.S., and healthcare costs of American adults with obesity amount to approximately $100 billion.

Recent studies on the epidemiology of anorexia have suggested an incidence of between 8 and 13 cases per 100,000 persons per year and an average prevalence of 0.3% using strict criteria for diagnosis. These studies also confirm the view that the condition largely affects young adolescent females, with females aged between 15 and 19 making up 40% of all cases. Furthermore, the majority of cases are unlikely to be in contact with mental health services.

While it was once thought that obesity was largely due to genes, it is not the case so much today.  Many people are eating for more reasons than sustaining hunger; psychological or mental disorders play a part, lack of activity, inadequate nutrients replace the nutritional value the body needs (i.e., fat burgers, fried foods, etc.).

With so few reporting their anorexic condition to the medical field, it is difficult to gauge numbers that would be in comparison to obesity to measure hospital costs, etc.

Personally, I think both conditions are problematic but would say that obesity is a bigger problem due to the NUMBER of individuals it has plagued.  WIth insufficient data to compare, it seems though, unlikely, that there are that many suffering from anorexia (by viewing physical appearance) than that of obese people (there seem to be more and more waddling around these days - and they are younger than before).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,I am not sure about this question in general.,,Obesity
0,54406,Why are people so quick to suggest pills as an answer to depression and other mental illness?,"Many times pills are not actually needed.  Out of 100 perscriptions a doctor writes, 5-10 of them may actually be necessary.  In many cases these drugs can worsen your health metally and physically.  Sometimes, I think,  people just need some time to figure things out.  I realize this is not always the case as I have stated above.  Some people are deffinitely in need of meds.  Before you take any drug you should do some research to see if the benefits outweigh the negative effects. These drugs cause serious side effects and are not always necessary.  That's the bottom line.","I think we live in a society who have come to think the solutions to all of life's problems comes in the form of a substance of one form or another.  Sometimes it is, and sometimes not.  I went through my own period of severe depression after my sister was killed.  I felt like my world had ended.  After months of downward spiraling, I decided to go to a doctor because the suicide thoughts were scaring me.  I wanted help.  I was given a prescription anti-depressant, and who knows, maybe that saved me.  I didn't feel good though.  I didn't really feel anything.  I didn't care for that.  I didn't like the other side effects either.  I stayed on them for a few months but eventually got off of them.  I struggled with depression for years afterward (about four).  It varied in degrees.  Sometimes I couldn't get out of bed, sometimes I could function.  I always felt a sense of impending doom.  Talking about how I felt with my friends and family helped a great deal, and time helped too.  But NOTHING helped as much as adopting a regular exercise program.  I eventually began running on an elliptical trainer at the gym for 45 minutes 3-5 days a week, and I was amazed at how great I felt.  It made me feel well-balanced and gave me a sense of well-being.  You hear it all of the time, ""exercise is important"".  I'll tell you, it is the only thing that helped me kick a serious bout of depression.  It has been five years since I have been depressed, and although I do not exercise as regularly as I did then, I still believe that it was regular exercise that cured me.",,,,,,,,,,,Why are people so quick to suggest pills as an answer to depression and other mental illness?,depression and other mental illness,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes: Before you take any drug you should do some research to see if the benefits outweigh the negative effects.

With that said:  



Hepatitis C is transmitted when the blood or body fluids from an infected person enters the body of a person who is not immune to the disease.

It can be spread by:

Having sex with an infected person without a condom (though experts don't know if condoms prevent transmission or just reduce it).
Sharing drugs and needles.
Being cut by infected needles (health care workers).
Birth from a mother to a child.
Hepatitis C is not spread through food, water, or by casual contact.

Unless you are sharing razors and bodily fluids with this guy, you are not in any danger.  You could hug him, kiss him, sit on his lap, hold his hand - all of these, all day long, and you would NOT get the disease.  

It is also not a form of HIV/AIDS, they are completely different diseases. 

I think it is wonderful that you would take someone in, but you should never do anything that you are not completely comfortable with.  You and your family are absolutely safe with this person unless you start sharing needles or having sex.  

I suggest going to www.webmd.com (i've included the link to a Hep C overview), www.wikipedia.org, and asking your family doctor for advice in order to make yourself absolutely comfortable.

I hope anyone whose had this same problem can help me out.","Just to relieve the itching...Stay cool and clean.  Warmth can irritate the itching even more.  Wear clothes with a smooth texture that doesn't irritate your skin--no denim.  Don't over-use lotions and soaps because these can irritate your skin even more--but by all means do use the lotion.  You may try (gross as it sounds) some Vaseline on the places where it really itches to cut off air circulation to the skin.  See if that helps any.  And rest up.  Feel better, okay? :-)",,,,,,,,,,,"I broke out in a rash overnight and I am extremely pissed off (I have of course stopped taking the medication).

20,1093581,How can I deal with this myself ?,"My Mom's not well.
She has crippling arthritis. She has had it since I can remember. (I'm 19) However she also has a very very bad back. She has had several operations in the past 15 or so years, including a Spinal Fusion. However, lately due to the arthritis she has grown increasingly worse. It takes her 3 minutes to get out of the car.
She has been told that she now has 3 options. 

- Continue getting injections into her spine. (These only give about 2 weeks of relief)
- Epidural (these are very painful and last just 3 weeks) or
- Surgery on the plates which are trapping the nerves in her back (This is very serious surgey which could lead to paralysis)

I try to be supportive. My father is doing his best too, however I also have medical problems which I am finding difficult to come to terms with.
I am really worried about everything.
I don't want to talk to anyone as I am the type of person who bottles everything up and deals with one thing at a time, but this is really....","That cant be easy to deal with at all! especially because it is someone you care a lot about.

its been 2 weeks....im now depressed....i dont know what else to do....im not happy my skin is kinda yellow, im always weak....please tell me what i can do...anything...plz","Oh my goodness...you need professional help sweetie. There are a lot of people out here that would love to help you, but bulemia is way out of our scope of knowledge. You need a doctor regardless of whether he tells your parents or not. We're talking about your life here love, and I'm sure you don't want to die, do you? If you see a doctor, he can refer you to a councillor for your problems, and there is good anti-depressant medications out there, although that's not always the answer either. You should start by calling a kids help-line or something along those lines. Something anonymous where they don't even need to know your name. Then you need to find a doctor, then you need to find a good councillor.  You need to move rather quickly though, as it sounds like you're jaundiced (your yellowing skin), which means your liver is having trouble. Just take things one day at a time, or if you have to, one hour at a time. After you have something to eat, get out of the house immediately, go for a walk, put something else in your mind besides getting rid of the food.  Think about something that makes you happy, a pet, a person, whatever you need to think about. Life is wonderful sweetie, although it may not seem like it right now. It is, I promise. You can get through this, I know you can, but it has to start with YOU. YOU are the one that needs to start taking these steps. No one can do it for you. I wish I was there so I could hold your hand. I really do, I feel so bad for you. So, remember, take baby steps, but please, start taking them as soon as you can. Time is of the essence here. You can ask the doctor not to tell your parents, but why don't you tell them first. Tell them of the problems you are having. Tell them about your bulemia, then tell them you are very very unhappy, and that you need help. Haven't your parents noticed a difference in you? And as far as other people. They may mean well, but you have to stop listening to them. You need to listen to a professional. You have to start caring for yourself. Get a little selfish. Make YOU number one right now, as you need to. Every day that goes by, things inside your body and your head are getting a little bit worse. I really believe that your parents HAVE to know, as you need support. I really hope I helped you...I really do. I will be praying for you, and praying for you and praying for you. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE let me know how you are doing. Leave me a note, PLEASE! I'll do whatever I have to do to help you. But, like I said, I'll be praying for you in the mean time.

I want to also talk with people that have this and see how it affected them. ((I have never started my period..duh if you were all wandering why i'm takeing all these tests))","I had never heard of MRKH.  So I googled MRKH and first off found www.mrkh.org.  

The signs and symptoms sound exactly like what you have described.

You usually discover that you have no vagina during puberty. Although you develop breasts and pubic hair, you do not start having periods. This is because the ovaries will produce the female hormones that make normal development occur but the absence of the uterus and vagina means that there is no period. Most of you report this when you are 15 or 16 years old.
However, some of you may have difficulties with having sex as your first problem.

What tests will I have?
Your GP will normally ask some questions and then examine you. Sometimes GPs feel that this examination is best done at a hospital by a gynaecologist and may refer you for this. During the examination, the doctor may discover that you have been born without a vagina.
Further investigations include:
 A blood test to check your chromosomes in order to exclude any other genetic abnormalities
 an ultrasound scan to confirm the absence of a womb but the presence of ovaries
As girls with this condition also have a 40% chance of having renal (kidney) problems or abnormalities, and 15% have a single kidney, a scan or X-ray of this area may also be recommended.  

Tough.

61,3428765,"For Parents Only, Please!! Does anyone have a child that has been diagnosed ADHD?","I thinking about taking my 7 yr old son to get tested for ADHD later this month. Last week I took my nieces to get shot and up on the wall was a list of symptoms for ADHD. And right away I thought of my son. Is it curable or just treatable? What things do they do at the evaluation? And what symptoms did your child have? My sons daydreams alot, he forgets when I just give him 1 task, he cant think on his homework, he gets angry and fustrated very easily. I thought all these things were pretty much common being a kid. To me I feel like he is hard on himself and i try everything to help him not to worry or be fustrated.I want to help him, but what should I do? What has worked for you and your child?","my son was diagnosed with adhd when he was in kindergarten.  I knew there was something wrong long before that but the Dr told me to wait until he was a little older. He also has been diagnosed with emotional disorder (bipolar) He was classified as having severe ADHD.  One thing I noticed right away was how hyper he was all the time. He couldn't handle any sort of stress. He would become irate if his routine changed even the littlest. He couldn't play with a group of children very long without becoming agitated or aggressive.  He couldn't follow simple tasks without being side tracked. He has his own space (which was big) and if it was invaded he would become aggressive and very upset.  He would become upset because he couldn't do the simple things other children around him were doing.  I spent several nights trying to help him learn his ABC's which would end in a huge crying session and him hitting himself.  In my case, my ex husband became the focus of some of his anger. He refuses to see him or talk to him because my ex would tease him about his problem.

My son's psychologist said that in some cases they can grow out of it.  (She has been a life saver and a big help in dealing with schools) In cases like my son where it is so severe and accompanied by a mental illness they will have to learn to live with it. It is easier to help them learn to live with it when it is caught young.

It is also a family issue.  Everyone will need to learn how to adjust and deal with the child.  They are not on the same wavelength as everyone else.  I've learned this over the last two years.  I have to deal with my daughter one way and my son another.

If your son is diganosed with ADHD, READ everything you can on it. Also, don't get just one oppionion. Try and get two.  They will give you and the school a test to fill out. Another thing is learn the law!!! It will come in handy.  I had to force a school to test my son so he could get an IEP. Even then you will have issues with the school.  Most schools are not equipped to deal with children like this and most educators don't have the patience or time to deal with them. 

I've been dealing with this for awhile.  I had to do alot of readjusting to help my son deal with this. The best thing for your child is to be involved and show them that no matter what you love them.",,,,,,,,,To me I feel like he is hard on himself and i try everything to help him not to worry or be fustrated.I,ADHD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Yes: I want to help him, but what should I do?",,,,,Yes:  The best thing for your child is to be involved and show them that no matter what you lo,,,ADHD

I'm experiencing kinds of headache for everyday, it feels tight and sometimes probing I'm so tired of feeling pain in my head.
Would it be caused by my schizoaffective disorder or something else? I've been to the hospital and they said my ray of brain is normal. Help me thanks.","Yes, talk to your doctor.  Perhaps it is connected to your medication, and only your doctor can advise you there.

The only time I suffered with headaches was when I took vitamin A or E tablets daily (separately).  It felt like I had overloaded the back of my head.  So now I don't take vitamin tablets and just make sure to treat myself to a balanced diet.  Although I know that there are some ailments that are treated with vitamins.

if it is past 13 weeks, it's not that big of a deal, (even though i wouldn't take any meds at the risk of my baby) but you should ask your doctor again, and if he is not helping you, call an obstetrician to find out.

75,4035741,How long does she have...Living with progressive multiple sclerosis?,"My Aunt was diagnosed with MS over 20 years ago. In the past 7 years she has gotted really bad, she basically has every symptom of progressive MS. It's so hard to see her like this at the age of 57. The medication she is on doesn't really help her. She has no blatter control, can barely walk, very moody, cant remember things or keep a conversation going and can barely walk. So I wonder, how long she may have until we have to put her in a nursing home or worse death.","No one can pin point the exact t ime of death for anyone.  But I would say that your aunt is depressed.  Think about it she should be inthe prime of her life enjoying herself and she has zero control.  Unfortunately MS is a progressive disease without cure.  Just be there for her.  Make sure that she has someone to take care of her at home.  You DO NOT want her to go to a nursing home where she will get substandard care.  PLus that will depress her more.  Losing her home will be devastating.  Make sure that is she is bed ridden that she gets turned every hour and if she is in a wheel chair make sure that she lies down to relieve the pressure on her cocyx.  You do not want her getting sores otherwise she will have to go to a home.  If she doesnt have a catheter think about her getting one It would reduce the risk of urine burns to her thighs, buttox, and vagina.  Imagine if your freedom was taken this is what it is like for her loss of control.  It is sad but she needs a strong network of family and friends with whom she can talk to.",,,,,,,,,"She has no blatter control, can barely walk, very moody, cant remember things or keep a conversation going and can barely walk.

It even feel like a headache,affecting even my eye hurts! Has anyone had this problem  and when u had the deep cleannig did it go away??","I recently had a scaling/cleaning done. I had a lot of plaque under my gums and the gums where pulling away from my bottom teeth. My dentist says I'm doing everything right but I need a cleaning every 3 months and a deep cleaning every year. Your teeth will be sensitive to cold and hot beverages until your teeth get the treatment but It's not going to go away over night. It's going to take a month or two of continous brushing, flossing, and useing Listerine at least twice a day. Make sure you see your dentist reguarly like every 2-3 months to get it under control. I also use Aquafresh Sensitive Maximum Strength toothpaste it stops the pain and I floss with Oral B Humming Bird Flosser its easier than using string floss and doesnt take long at all and hurts less too. Also, use a soft brush this also helps reduce pain when brushing.

However, I think this is all due to allergies (even tho I've never had in past - I'm 54).  Sometimes at night I wake up 2-3 times every hour with a cough that doesn't stop unless I drink some cold water and blow my nose.  I also was unable to have my windows open this fall because I would start to cough.  I think that I've gradually developed various allergies possibly originating from having cats.  I'm very frustrated and don't want to give my cats away but I'm becoming concerned about all this constant coughing.  Please help.","You should see an allergy specialist.  

The fact that it gets worse at night leads me to believe you are allergic to dust mites.  They are microscopic little creatures that love bedding.  It also sounds to me like your allergy is pretty severe.  I'm allergic to dust mites and my only problem has been a little snoring.  I take Clariton at night to help fight it.  

By any chance, did you by a new pillow around the same time the coughing started?  That could be your source.

I have had 4 surgeries for endometriosis, 3 crio-surgeries, and I have poly-cystic ovarian syndrome.  I wanted to know what the success rate of IUI's are.

I was also taking Gonal F and Pergonyl with Progesterone supposatories at the end of my cycle.

The success rate varies from fertility clinic to fertility clinic and depends on each couple and their fertility stats.  My doctor told me that I had a 30% chance of getting pg every month.  Which is a lot higher than the regular pregnancy rate!

BTW, it was the hugely botched cycle that I conceived on!  So, even if it isn't perfectly timed (we were off by THREE days) you still have a chance.  Just keep getting busy!

I am speaking from experience. I have had two miscarraiges.
My first one was called a missed Miscarraige because the baby stoped growing in utero and my body did not recognize that the pregnancy had ended, and I had to have a D & C.

Does this sound like morning sickness or is this just me being paranoid?","If you had a period since having sex...probably not morning sickness. And if it has been going on for more than a few weeks, it could be food allergies. You can develop them at any time, even with a food you have never had a problem with before. With lots of gas it might be dairy. Try organic milk or see how you feel after other foods. I have a gluten allergy (wheat, rye, barley) and it didnt start to make me sick until after I was 20!

They said that this should not cause a fever for this long. I take her back in the morning. They are thinking the next step is maybe a bladder infection or something along those lines. She will not give a urine sample period. We've tried the hat in the toilet, going in the potty, and even the bag that sticks on her genital to catch the urine. Nothing is working.

I have always been shy but I think that my shyness is something more serious.  I don't get the anxiety, panic attacks or tremors that people with Social Anxiety Disorder get, but I'm more than just ""shy"" when it comes to talking with people, especially females.

The only main thought in my head is ""Don't F*** this up!!!!"".  By doing this, I put intense pressure on myself.  A girl could tell me her name and it won't even come close to being remembered because the only thing I am thinking is ""Is she interested in talking to me?"" or ""she probably thinks I'm an idiot"".

It's funny, I won't shut the hell up in front of people I know or in a setting where I know I will be funny/ liked but the second you put me with a stranger, I can't communicate.

Is this something I should talk to my physician about?  Perhaps a therapist?  Not sure where the best place for help is...","Sounds to me like you suffer from low self esteem.  You don't think you're good enough for other people to like you, so you are worried that they won't.  You are so obsessed with what they think of you, that you aren't even paying attention to them.  So, they probably won't like you...no one likes to be ignored when they are talking, which will only make your problem worse.

If you want to get comfortable with someone, you have to get to know them.  The best way to do this is to get them talking about themselves.   Listen to what they say.  Respond to them.

Nerves can be bad, but there is no magic pill that will fix what your problem is.  Only practice can help.  Don't worry about what the other person thinks about you. The worse that can happen is they won't be interested and you move on.  Try not to pressure yourself and try to relax and be yourself.

I landed in the intensive care unit in my 2nd job and in my more recent job, I had taken so many days of medical leave that the company decide they had to let me go.

I am still a patient at the mental institute seeing the psychiatrist for medication.

I have a university degree and I have been applying for new jobs. i never stated that I have any mental disorder in the application form else I would never have a chance to be shortlisted.

But the trauma of my past few jobs have been so great that I find myself resisting going for interviews and then feeling very guilty. 

My mind tells me to look for a job but my feelings are in conflict. I am just so frightened and so resistent. It can be quite tiring hiding the fact that I am mentally ill from the employers and they find out eventually.

Can I give myself a break?","Before rushing into finding a new job, you should really work through all these issues with your therapist. Do you have a good therapist that you like and trust? If not, you should concentrate on finding one because all of these fears and apprehensions you have need to be talked out so you are not going into your new job with all that baggage with you. You CAN start again and succeed, but you really need to leave those past failures behind you where they belong.

I am experiencing the same problem as you. I can't carry either. After the second miscarriage I haven't gotten pregnant at all. There is nothing wrong with either my husband or myself either. In fact my husband has 2 children from previous marriage and although I love my stepchildren as they are my own it's not the same. I feel the same way, seeing all these crackheads and pedophiles having children that are not wanted or abused and I literally have a breakdown when I hear of an abandoned baby or a baby killed and thrown in the garbage, but the best way that I look at it is (and I'm not a very religious person) when God is ready He will let me have one.

31,1437242,Pregnancy and mood-swings?,"My family don't believe that pregnant women get mood-swings and get overemotional. Well they kind of do but they think that at 2 months pregnant it's 'too soon for that kind of thing' and I'm just attention-seeking.

I thought, maybe they're right so I tried really hard to 'snap out of it' and 'control myself' but it didn't help and I really, really tried hard. I keep bursting into tears for no reason and I don't even know why I'm crying. I'm phobic about childbirth and I'm really worried why I don't feel any affection towards the unborn baby yet.

It doesn't seem real yet. I don't even have a bump yet. all I have is painful, swollen breasts, abdominal cramps and depression. I keep having scary dreams about the baby being born dead, or having a miscarriage or it being deformed or it being born and then dying of cot-death or of it being born perfect but I'm such a bad mother that I don't know how to look after it and it dies.

I don't know what to do.",Every thing that you are feeling is normal.  It's almost as soon as you find out that your pregnant the worrying starts.  All most everyone experiences some level of these feelings. Your emotions are very different when your pregnant and everyone deals with them differently.  Not knowing what life is going to be like with a newborn and not knowing what the delivery is going to be like is also very scary.  I would get as much information as you can about delivery and baby development in the uterus as well as talking to your Dr about all the feelings you are feeling.  You may be at risk of postpartum depression (which is also very normal).

I took a shower and some Benadryl, and felt better.  This morning it was no longer noticeable and wasn't itchy, so I went to school.  However, after a fire drill (in which we went outside on a hill near the school, nowhere near the softball field) I noticed the rash again, now also on my hands.  I called my mom to come pick me up, and I am now sitting in her office at work, feeling fine after more Benadryl.  I am, however, still wondering what is happening to me.  Am I allergic to the weed killer, or a bug bite I got or something?  Or is it more serious?  If you have ever experienced or heard of this, please answer.  Thanks!","definetly call an allergy specialist now and book an appointment-and make sure you insist that it's soon, preferably today while you have the rash so you can show it to them as it's happening.  they can run tests and give you medication-maybe something besides benadryl-and you will know what is going on.  the fact that you had an allergy two days in a row of this sort suggests to me that your immune system is changing, so it'd help to get a doctor's opinion to minimize the risk of a third attack anytime soon.  you could be allergic to something you are eating..you could be allergic to the weed killer-those things tend to be airbourne, right?  so it wouldn't necessarily mean you have to be ON the field, merely being near it could trigger an attack.  you could also being having exercise-induced allergies, which is where people sometimes get rashes all over after doing anything physical like running, jogging, doing sports etc.  allergies are sneaky and hard to decode, that's why you need to get a professional's thoughts on the matter.  think of it this way-the sooner you act, the sooner you have answers and take it all under control.  you poor thing-i hope you feel better soon.  thoughts are with you.  good luck!",allergic reaction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I am, however, still wondering what is happening to me.",allergic reaction,,,,,,,,,"Am I allergic to the weed killer, or a bug bite I got or something?

I get feelings of peace, feel loved, feel successful.  Then later I feel hopeless, unloved, neglected.  I have been diagnosed as having depression and anxiety disorder by my nurse practioner.  I don't trust her judgement because she prescribed medication without really giving any kind of diagnostic test.  I was prescribed Lexapro and Niravam.  The Lexapro didn't seem to help much, made me sick, and made me gain weight.  I just stopped taking it.  It's been so bad at times, I wanted to check myself into the hospital because I felt like I wanted to die.  I don't know what to do.  I feel like no one, not even the nurse or doctors, ever takes me seriously.  I am extremely depressed right now.  Yesterday I was really bad and isolated myself from my fiance and my family.","I agree with not trusting the fact that you were given meds without a diagnostic process of any kind. However, there are a few things that can contribute to mood swings. The most obvious is bipolar disorder (aka manic depression), and there's also menopause (I don't know your age or sex), diet, and just clinical depression which can manifest in many different ways - some people can even have hallucinations with profound depression. 

I suggest that you change doctors and explain all of this to the new doctor. Tell him that you are looking for a doctor that will actually examine and test your symptoms. Let him know what meds you have tried and all the effects they have had. 

You do need to realize that many mental health medications have side effects like the ones you mentioned. You may be able to find one that has fewer effects, but never stop taking a med until you have called your doc and notified him of the problem. These kind of meds need to be kept at an even level in your system, and it can cause more harm than good to take them sporadically or to stop suddenly.

It is a good idea to keep a journal - keep track of your moods - list the feeling, the strength of the feeling, the cause of the feeling (if there is one), the time you began feeling this way, etc. Take this journal with you when you see the doctor.",mood swings,,,,I am extremely depressed right now.,depressed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I don't trust her judgement because she prescribed medication without really giving any kind of diagnostic test.,medication,,,,,,"I have mood swings throughout the day, and I can actually feel myself going in and out of them?",,,,,Yes: I agree with not trusting the fact that you were given meds without a diagnostic process of any kind. ,,,

I don't know what to do about--- My fiance tells me to be patient a little longer< that he feels secure in our relationship, but then he stands me up Thanksgiving with his family","I work in a chemo ward, and I see the things that families do to each other when one of them is diagnosed with cancer;
I have seen partners shut out and isolated, I have seen people at each other's throats; everyone wants to be close to the patient; everyone wants to protect him.
Your fiancee has been through a life changing event. He looks at life differently now. It must be very hard for you to be sidelined like this. How cruel of his family to shut you out at this time; this doesn't bode well for your future married life together.
Write to his family; say you would like the opportunity to clear the air - that you love him very much, and that you want to be part of his life - the bad bits as well as the good bits. Try not to allocate blame; and try not to be self pitying when you speak to them.
It sounds like your fiancee made his decision when he moved back in with them; I wonder why he felt he had to do that? For the moment, you may have to take his word that things are ok between you.
I would think that things are not ok.
You are supposed to be his bride-to-be; you are on the verge of married life together. I wonder about his level of committment to you if he ran home when trouble raised it's head.
Sorry to be a devil's advocate here, but I would not be happy with that situation at all.
Treatment does change people; families often close ranks against those whom they consider to be ""outsiders"". Still, I think they are being unesscessarily cruel here. Was there some conflict between you and them before his illness?Do they not approve of you for some reason?
It was a truly horrible and unchristian thing to do, to leave you out of Thanksgiving. It should be a time of rejoicing and reconcilation; and why did he not insist on you being invited?
Having cancer does not mean you turn into a little boy again.
I'm very sorry for you, that is awful. You are suffering too, worrying about him and your future.
I think you are entitled to some answers from him; a long talk between you both should be arranged. you are a part of his life, he should affirm that in some way, and if he does not, I would seriously wonder whether you should continue to wait for him.
Best wishes.",cancer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ok this is kinda long, but I'm so confused -- my fiance' got diagnosed with stage 3 vocal chord cancer in Augus",cancer,,,,,,,,,Help me understand how families deal with cancer -  family has no extended family?,,"Yes: 'm very sorry for you, that is awful.

I suggest starting with an endocrinologist.  If you have a hormone or thyroid problem it is easy enough to fix.  Incompetent cervix could be another cause and easily fixed.  I had 6 miscarriges before I had my son and it ended up being due to low estrogin levels easily fixed with supplements.

My son is also ADHD and his teachers shoveled him off unless they had some kind of evaluation coming up by the state or other authority. then they would work with him to ensure that he got as good a grade as possible and make them look good. When it was over he was right back in the corner again.  He is now home schooled and doing alot better.  I recommend that you find activities he likes and use those as a way to educate, eg. baseball,  ask a question or for a spelling word, if correct, throw the ball and let him try to get a hit, if wrong strike one, and so on.  If he will not settle enough for a real classroom environment you will need to find ways to channel his energy constructively.

If it's prickly heat, in an adult it's usually nothing to worry about and will go away - though the thing that makes me doubt this diagnosis is that it doesn't bother you at all.

The allergen is either something she is exposed to externally or something she is getting from your breastmilk or from the infant formula your using. try changing formulas if your using them. If breastmilk, then you must start the process of elimination and see what makes a difference when you exclude it from your diet. A good indicator can be some thing you eat that unsettles her after feeding time. Possibly find out from a Naturopath what foods you are sensitive to and eliminate those from your diet also as they can pass through as well. Try changing the covers and clothes you use to natural fabrics as well.
Antihistamines are not great for infants and are a last resort. Try some Calendular Ointment, this will sooth the rash as will bathing with Chamomile Tea. See this website http://www.carolineskincare.com.au this is a wonderful natural product that can help as well, I have used it a lot in my clinic and on my own kids. These are only topical (external)treatments, the underlying allergen (cause) needs to be found and gotten rid of so please do not think that it has cleared when the rash dies down a bit.
It is also possible she has Psoriasis which is also aggravated by allergies and heat.

Congratulations on sticking with the AA program. You are doing a great job and I hope you stick with it. You have made another positive step forward by putting yourself out on Answers.

I am not an alcoholic, but several of my friends are and I have done everything possible to support them, so, I hope that I have some advice/insight that benefits you.

First and foremost, ask your fellow AA members, as well as AA management, about any doctors they would specifically recommend who are sensitive to the needs of recovering alcoholics/addicts.

You are right: recovering alcoholics face some specific health concerns best dealt with by a doctor who understands.

Diabetes, liver disease, digestive problems, cardiac, hepatitis, ocular disease, and immune system problems are all side effects of alcoholism.

This website below is a special AA website for doctors who are also recovering alcoholics:
http://www.idaa.org/
Contact them. They will be able to provide you with doctors sensitive to your needs.

The original AA founder's home:
http://www.drbobshome.org/index.html
Send them an email explaining your situation. They will find a way to provide information to you.

I would start off with these two sites and build from there. With time spent researching your concerns, you will discover a lot more information.

Keep on doing what you are doing: asking questions, being strong, reminding yourself what is really important, and your willingness to want to help others is very inspiring.

I think you will be very successful with continuing to control your alcoholism and your desire to help others is the most powerful medicine of all for you.

The world today is built like that, unfortunately. Sometimes, you just cannot control everything and your body is your best example. you should analyze what kind of situations cause those panic attacks or anxiety attacks.

7,4255782,My migraines have went from bad to worse. Can anyone PLEASE HELP me?,"I'm 25 and started having migraines at the age 9.  In the last 3mos, they have been different,  I have lost my sight once with one, and I now stutter or am unable to speak the words I want to when I have a migraine. Then to top it off I am now having siezers. And my hands shake even when I don't have a migraine. I had an EEG but there was nothing. I have been under stess.(trying to buy a new house, fight with the inlaws, and kids) I really thought I was ok with all of this. I started depakote on may 2nd. and yet still all this is happening I am now up to 500mg twice a day. Can anyone think of anything that might help. I'm tired of the feeling that people think it's all in my head. PLEASE HELP","I'm a nurse practioner who treats only women so I see TONS of women suffering with stess reactions and migranes. If you are having true siezures where you pass out and have the classic jerking movements,you should have an MRI of your brain to be certain that there isn't anything such as a tumor causing these new symptoms. An MRI is a special imaging test that can actually see these lobes of the brain,blood vessels and bony structures,kind of like an Xray but able to see things the Xray can't. Your shaking hands sound more like anxiety and or panic. A panic attack can feel like you're having a heart attack and a few people will actually pass out or have odd movements that can be misdiagnosed as a siezure. The migranes can often be controlled or at least made more manageable with daily medication. I'd suggest you talk to your health care provider and ask to be put on something like Lexipro or Paxil. These are both antidepressants but are also excellent for dealing with stress and anxiety and can also decrease the frequency and severity of the headaches.If you notice that your headaches are the worst on your period or about halfway between them and you're not on birth control pill somtiimes taking the pill to even out the hormone  levels can be helpful.I often use a drug called Verapamil taken daily to try and prevent you from having as many headaches.It's a blood pressure med but acts to prevent some of the changes in the brain that cause the migrane pain. I'm a migrane sufferer too and last year mine got ugly but since I started Verapamil in August I haven't had one at all . I've had the aura several times but the pain never came. I was surprised that it worked this well.Usually, it makes things more managable at least.There are other thing that can help such as feverfew supplement, magnesium or a B vitamin called riboflavin. These need to be taken daily and take a while to become effective. Don't give up till you get some relief. Your best bet is to find someone who specializes in women's issues or a headache specialist if none of the usual things work. I know this is a long answer but it's a complicated problem. There!

You need to be objective and explain that it is too much for you as a 15year to be looking after your brother all this time, you have your own life too. Would it be possible to get a care worker that could come and watch your brother when they work. Or could you come to a compromise where you look after him less and someone else watches him(care worker/sibling/family member) at other times.
I'm from the UK, so US may be different but in the UK your family would be entitled to a full-time care worker for free. Maybe your family are entitled to something similar.

With this you need to make your parents clear on what he does and how it makes you feel(does it distress you?). Further I think that you a should keep in mind the Police have a duty to come round if you feel unsafe or he is going to far. Nothing bad will happen to your brother they will just calm him down and restrain him(reasonably). He won't go to jail as they will understand his symptoms. Its important to know that the Police are there to help citizens not just catch criminals.","autism, ADHD and Asperger's syndrome",,,,,,,,,,starts pounding on the futon that is destroyed and pictures of my dads medals (he was in the army) start falling off and he does not care all he cares about is the playstation.,starts pounding on the futon that is destroyed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Can You give me some advice please that would be greatly appreciated!!,,Yes: It sounds unfair.

I haven't had any other signs of ovulation at all","Well, it's saying that based on your temperature pattern.

It's never personally happened to me, but apparently to the program it looks like ovulation.  

If you have a stronger ovulation temperature pattern on day 18, yes, it will change.  Then the program will recognize that the earlier one was just a fluke, because of the weather or sickness or whatever the reason was for your temperatures mimicking ovulation.

Just stick with what you are doing and cut the cable off, and maybe take away the games. Just for a few months and see if he improves at school.

Yes, you are right. You do have a normal six year old boy. You could also try using some other sort of methods to increase his attention span.

1) TV Time Needs To Be Trimmed - A child's attention span only lasts about 8 to 10 minutes. Funny that 8 to 10 minutes is how long a television program is on for until it breaks for commercial.

2) Games and Gadgets - When it comes to game systems, just remove them from the picture. Two ways to do so, A) Take them from him while he is either using them or is around or B) Move them into a place where only you know the whereabouts when he is at school.

Some might also suggest using educational games to help but I have found that t defeats the purpose of taking away games all together. Besides, he needs to learn to stay focused and not get better hand eye coordination. Maybe to hone some math or english skills, but not for what you're dealing with right now.

thanxs to anyone who responds...
much love; caroline <3 xoxox","Caroline, you sound like a real sweetie :) The way you can tell if you have an eating disorder is if you find yourself constantly obsessing with calories and with your weight. 
If you eat , but you in eat in very small amounts, if you find yourself purging (eating and then vomiting or taking laxatives) ANother thing is if you avoid certain foods because you are constantly afraid of fat intake. For example you are afraid of eating a hamburger because you think it will make you fat. 

People that have eating disorders are constantly afraid of getting fat, they are constantly obesessing with calories, they eat very little, they only eat certain foods For example, some lady on here was telling us that she ate nothing but cantelope and drank water and could not figure out why she wasn't losing weight. Basically you have a fear of eating because you don't want to get fat

When I was a kid, I went through a phase of not eating breakfast. I just didn't want to, I would get up and I wasn't hungry, but I had to  learn to eat it because if I didn't I would get terrible stomachaches. When I was 14 I just completely lost my appetite and I was getting terribly skinny and it worried my mom so she was giving me my favorite foods to help me regain my appetite. 

YOu didn't ask an odd or stupid question. Maybe ...you should suggest that your parents and you go to counseling so that you can get this resolved or maybe you should suggest that they get some information on eating disorders. I know that it must be frustrating for you. They are just concerned parents. Maybe a little counseling will help you guys or maybe learning about the true facts together. 

They just may be overly concerned feeling that you should eat more or something. I don't know

I am in my late 20's, and my right foot has been slightly swollen for about 8 years now.  At first I didn't get it checked out because I was in school and couldn't afford health insurance (don't you love our country's priorities?).  Over the last couple of years I have been to several different types of doctors and noone seems to know what is wrong.  Here are some of the things I've heard:
My regular dr did blood work and bone scan....nothing.
A podiatrist did an x-ray....nothing.
A vascular surgeon examined it and said it maybe Venus [something] syndrom where the valves in my leg don't let the blood through...but he wasn't sure.
I had my legs scanned by a sonagram technichian and she said there is a thickening of the outer vein in both legs that was maybe caused by a previous blood clot...but wasn't sure.  She said I didn't have to worry about blood clots (of course I asked).
I have never had any pain or discolorization. ideas?","Because it is one leg only it seems to relate to the energy flow on the affected side.  Think of any possible cause of this condition. Check your posture in the mirror--are you favouring one leg? In school this can happen easily when one carries heavy knapsacks on one shoulder. Emotionally the right side of our body relates to the male energy.  What issue can you connect with the swelling , what happened in your life around the time the swelling started? There is a reason for everything. It might sound silly but ask your body for a cause and for a remedy before you go to sleep.  Expect an answer to come and it will soon. Good luck!
In addition, there a few things you can do to improve blood circulation in your feet;
Please change the type of socks you wear--Pure cotton, or pure wool are best, no elastic and  no nylon. Also try to elevate the foot above the heart level several times a day. Make sure you do not cross your feet while sitting or lying in bed.  Drink, preferably boiled water at room temperature, often enough to keep your pee colourless and free of smell.  Reduce yeast in your diet. Make sure your nostrils are free and allow for an equal air supply--close one nostril and inhale deeply then exhale, in a few times, then out a few times. Repeat with other nostril. try leg stretches at least twice a day.  Every bit helps.  Expect your body to find a way to correct the condition soon.

You do sound like you may have some depression and/or anxiety issues. The good thing is that you have already started the road to recovery by reaching out for help. Both depression and anxiety are very curable. I have had both of these, and counseling really helped me. 

Please know that when you are feeling like this is part of being down, and that things can get better. Your fears of not being good enough are very common to people who are depressed and people in general! I don't think there are many people who have not privately felt that they are not ""good enough"".  Self confidence can be learned. In the meantime, be gentle to yourself - you deserve it. 

You sound like you could benefit from going to counseling. There are many ways to do this. You can get a referral from a community information center or 211 if there is a 211 line in your area. If you do not have benefits at work, there are some non-profit agencies if money is an issue. Some faith communities have trained counselors as well.  If you have a good relationship with your family doctor, you could also talk to them about this and see if they have some referrals.

If you have any personal pain reduces of cramps, please let me know.  Also, include any funny stories about your first experience with your memstral cycle.  This is so the girls feels confortable when they finally get their cycle and also to let them know that it is a way of life that we as women all go through.","Hot water bottles and heating pads saved me, I had cramps so bad at least once a month my mom would have to take me out of school.

Nowadays I am on Seasonale, so I only get periods 4 times a month. It is HEAVEN!

Here's my funny story - I was a late-bloomer, I didn't get mine until I was in 9th grade. I was on the phone talking to a friend, and happened to be wearing a jean skirt (does this date me??!!). I look down and I see what has happened. I carefully walk to the kitchen where my parents were eating dinner, and tell my mom that I need to speak to her. ""What is it?"" she asks, in front of my dad. Again I tell her I need to speak to her, and again she wants me to tell her in front of my dad. Needless to say, I finally pulled her into the bathroom, asked her if I had indeed gotten my period, and she said yes. I was already prepared, having ordered a box through mail order that had info booklets, pads, etc. The funniest thing was that my dad, once my mom told him, didn't know what to do.

31,4081162,Newborn anxiety?,"So here is my story.... after 3 years of marriage and much discussion and planning, my husband and I decided to have a baby. Took all of one try (no kidding). Everything was fine up until week 24, I started having contractions and am now bed bound until our daughter arrives. So here I am, almost 29 weeks pregnant and attempting to register for my shower, and I just realized something. Our baby is going to be born, we are going to get her home.... and then what? I am chalking it up to hormones and the fact that this is our first baby, but just realized I am scared to death! Hubby has never really been around babies, the only experience I have is babysitting 10 years ago. I already love my daughter, I have loved her from the first day I found out I was pregnant... I don't want to screw her up! Please tell me some of you brand new parents have been through this!","Oh!  CONGRATULATIONS on your pregnancy.  I'm sorry to hear that you are on bedrest but I'm glad to hear you are taking care of yourself and doing what you need to do to finish baking her and bring her in safe and sound.

I was 31 when I had my first baby and 35 when I just had my third one.  So I was a bit older.  I had done a TON of babysitting in my younger days and my sister and I are 8 years apart and I did lots and lots of care for her when she was born and afterwards!

But yet..I was still completely terrified when it was my own baby.  Now *I* was responsible for raising this child and *I* was responsible for how it turns out as an adult.  HOW SCARY IS THIS????

But you know what?  I have to live and learn..make my mistakes..and move on.  And you will too.  

You might not be able to because of your bed rest but I recommend taking a child birth class.  If you can't do that then a Newborn basics class is pretty helpful.  It will teach you how to put on a diaper, bathe the baby, infant CPR, how to swaddle a baby (KEY if you want them to sleep better)--how often they need to be fed..just basic things for a happy, healthy, baby.

Even though the newborn stage is so difficult becuase of the lack of sleep..guess what?  That is the easy part!  It gets harder when they get older and then you have to start using redirection and discipline.  Then you really start questioning your parenting abilities!

So enjoy the newborn stage.  It goes REALLY REALLY REALLY fast.  

You really will be okay.  You are already ahead of the game!  You have your husband's support AND you already love your baby.  You will do just fine!

If you really want more input from others though--you can continue to do what you are already doing..research on the Internet.

There are great sites out there that helped me get through all three of my pregnancies.  Just knowing there are others out there who we can direct our questions to or just get moral support (newborns are HARD work!)is AWESOME!  There's two sites in particular that I will list below.  You can join the Birth club for the date that your baby is due and then you are all be pregnant at the same time and you can get to know these people over the span of the pregnancy and you can hear the birth stories of the people who are due ahead of you and then you can continue to network with these people and ask questions and get advice as the babies grow!  It also sends you week-by-week updates on what is happening with your baby during the pregnancy adn then what is hpapenign with the baby's develpoment once she's been born.  It's great.  

In addition to Internet resouces--Doctors are good resouces.  Some sites on the Internet are good resouces.  Other Mommies are good resources.  Your own Mom is a good resource (if she's still in your life).  You will be okay.

36,1045175,What is Oxalic Acid and why does Joe Hart call it God's chemotherapy?,"Colonel Joe Hart of http://www.coljoe.com contends that Oxalic acid in your immune system will cure everything from virus, bacteria, and fungi infections within our bodies.  He writes that  by maximizing and keeping in balance the Oxalic acid in our bodies, we can maintain an immune system capable at keeping all forms of cancer out of our bodies, as well as shrink existing cancers now present in your body.  He list a number of baddies, called blockers which will and can totally drain the Oxalic Acid out of our bodies in less than an hour, and suggest that we totally avoid these blockers at all cost but particularly if you are sick with any malady. Ever hear of this before on any topic of discussion concerning this chemical substance? The chemical based compound which is imported into this country is used primarily as an ethching agent to clean things such as radiators. But the Oxalic Acid Col. joe is refering to occurs and is found in our diet, primarily dark leafy veggies.","Whatever Colonel Joe calls Oxalic Acid may or may not be what Wikapedia calls Oxalic Acid. I listened to Col Joe on a radio show and he claimed that fresh juiced carrot was the best source of oxalic acid. Carrot Juice may contain trace amounts of oaxalic acid but there is a lot more going on with carrots that makes it a wonderful juice when added to one's daily diet.

As far as Colonel Joe's stand on Vitamin C, I can see how it relates to Oaxalic Acid but I couldn't disagree more about Vitamin C's health benefits. Vitamin C is a first rate healing vitamin as proven by hundreds of double blind placebo controlled studies.

As far Vitamin B-6 goes, I believe there needs to be a balance of B-Vitamins if B Vitamins are being used as a supplement

In any case, I believe Colonel Joe has had great success from helping hundreds of chronically ill people looking for a way to overcome Cancer and other deadly diseases. There are many directions to the same place and perhaps Colonel Joe's healing modality works just fine. There are many good things on Colonel Joe's list of good things to eat. If you get enough of those good foods then you might not need those foods with Vitamin C and B-6.

(8)Autistic Kids.
1. Autistic Kids Disorder 
Autistic Kids symptoms:

(A) total of six (or more) items from (1), (2), and (3), 
with at least two from (1),
and one each from (2) and (3): 


1. Autism Autistic Kids qualitative impairment in social interaction, as manifested by at least two of the following: 
(a) Impairment in the use of multiple non-verbal behaviors such as eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression, body postures, and gestures to regulate social interaction 
(b) failure to developed relationships appropriate to developmental level 
(c) a lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or achievements with other people (e.g., by a lack of showing, bringing, or pointing out objects of interest) 
(d) lack of social or emotional response


2. Autism qualitative impairments in communication as manifested by at least one of the following: 
(a) delay in, or total lack of, the development of spoken language (not accompanied by an attempt to compensate through alternative modes of communication such as gestures or mime) 
(b) without adequate speech, marked impairment by in the ability to initiate or sustain a conversation with others 
(c) repetitive use of language or words or phases
(d) lack of varied, spontaneous make-believe play or social imitative play appropriate to developmental level 


3. Autism restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities, as manifested by at least one of the following: 
(a) autism encompassing preoccupation with one or more stereotyped patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus 
(b) autism apparently inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional routines or rituals 
(c) stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms (e.g., hand or finger flapping or twisting, or complex whole-body movements or with an object) 
(d) autism persistent of liking an object, movements with sound.


(B) Delays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas,
with onset around 2 and half of age to 3 and half years old:
(1) social interaction, 
(2) language as used in social communication, or 
(3) symbolic or imaginative play (playing or talking some form of outer space words or cartoon's words or play). 


Symptoms of Asperser's include: impaired ability to utilize social cues such as body language, irony, or other subtext of communication; restricted eye contact and socialization; limited range of encyclopedic interests; preservative, odd behaviors; didactic, verbose, monotone, droning voice; concrete thinking; over-sensitivity to certain stimuli; and unusual movements. 

All these are the symptom of autism and we have the treatment for all these problem. You have to spend enough time for the intensive treatment in order to get good result, it varies from 1 month to 6 months or more for intensive treatment (remedies, remedy).
Some of the Autistic kids that is difficult to get near to 100 % cure is that they started late on themselves more then 11 years old for some, and others are too stubborn, but we still gets major improvement about 80-90% or so until they can get easy living in their life.
We have long distance friends that",I think that this like many other things that have come and gone in the past years is unfortunatly not a cure.  People are always claiming that a diet or something is going to cure autism.  I work with children with autism and I've never heard about this working.  I know 5 years ago when they thought vaccines may be causing autism it was all over the news.  I think if it did it would be on the news and all over the place - because a cure for autism would be a big deal.  This may be a good treatment for some children but I don't think cure is the right word.

44,3776251,Missed Miscarriage?,"I just had my 9 week ultra sound to see the baby's heart beat.  Unfortunately, we didnt see one.  My dr. said that the baby should have been miscarried, but for some reason my body held onto it.  The baby doesnt have a heart beat, and she has no requested for some blood work to be done, and I am scheduled to have a procedure done on friday to expel the baby.  Are there any chances the dr could be wrong?  She said that its just an abnormal sperm or egg where the baby isnt developing correct, and it had nothing to do with what I could or couldnt do.  

This would be my first child and both my husband and I are sooo devastated.  Has this happened to anyone else?","I'm so sorry to hear this. To answer your question, yes this has happened to me. With my first pregnancy I began bleeding at 13 weeks. When I went to the doctor it appeared that the baby had not been growing for around 5 to 6 weeks. 

I would definitely request a second ultrasound so that you can see for certain what is going on. It helps to know. 

It has been speculated that nearly half of pregnancies end in miscarriage. There are many reasons that it happens, but in most cases it's just something isn't developing correctly. 

I'm not sure if it's much consolation to you, but I went on to have another baby less than a year later, two years after that, I had another baby.

This hurt so much, and i was lost without her. she said so many hateful things to me, and i returned the favour to her. well after 1 month of not talking her mum called me and told me she was in the hospital and really really sick.

I went to the hospital and found she has cancer and wouldn't be alive much longer, she could barely talk. she told me that she pushed me away because she wanted me to get used to her not being there before she had to leave. She died the next day...

She was like a sister to me, and now I'll never get to see her again, why couldn't she just tell me, i feel so guilty about the things i said to her, how can i feel better about it? i just wish i could say sorry...","first of all, your friend was trying to protect you.  When things go wrong like that we as humans always seem to hurt the ones we love and those closest to us. maybe she was trying to safe you the pain and anguish of having to watch her die.and I am sure she was scared, both of dying and of how you might react.  It is always hard when a life ends with unfinished busines like this. I am sure if you knew the facts, then you would not have said these things to her, but i am sure she will forgive you.  WHen you went to the hospital did you tell her you did not mean what was said, as I am sure she appologised as well.  Only thing that can help is yourself, you have to accept that this was not under normal circumstances that this happened, and your friend did start by saying hurtful things to you.  People deal with things differently in life and this was her way off dealing with things.

Best advice I can give is for you to give it time, and if time is not the answer then find someone who you can talk to, a friend, doctor or a councilor.  Try going to her grave and talk to her tell her you are sorry.  Perhaps you can raise funds in her name for the cancer unit at the local hospital as away of easing the burden.  If you are a believer in psychics and mediums, then they can help you con5tact her or pass on a message.  my e mail address if you need to chat is trishaf2001@yahoo.co.uk drop me a line f you want and we can go to msn and chat there  hope this helps.  just remember the good times

Can You give me some advice please that would be greatly appreciated!!,"It sounds unfair. But being part of a family is about coming together as unit and working towards all of your happiness and prosperity. If you parents have to work and can't be provided with a care worker to watch you brother then I guess they have no choice.
I must be very difficult to have a brother with these syndromes and I have alot of respect for you for looking after your brother...its not a task any of your family asked for and I'm sure you love him very much.
Its sounds like you should  sit down and talk calmly to your parents about this when they are not busy themselves(ie not stressed). You need to be objective and explain that it is too much for you as a 15year to be looking after your brother all this time, you have your own life too. Would it be possible to get a care worker that could come and watch your brother when they work. Or could you come to a compromise where you look after him less and someone else watches him(care worker/sibling/family member) at other times.
I'm from the UK, so US may be different but in the UK your family would be entitled to a full-time care worker for free. Maybe your family are entitled to something similar.
ISSuE;HE BECOMES VIOLENT TO YOUR FURNISHINGS WHEN HE DIES ON PLAYSTATION
With this you need to make your parents clear on what he does and how it makes you feel(does it distress you?). Further I think that you a should keep in mind the Police have a duty to come round if you feel unsafe or he is going to far. Nothing bad will happen to your brother they will just calm him down and restrain him(reasonably). He won't go to jail as they will understand his symptoms.

 Last year I had a episode where the unit discharged five times about one minute apart, felt like getting hit in the chest with a sledge hammer.
  After that episode I feel a bit anxious about the next time this may accour, believe me Im not looking foreward to it.
  Are there other people that feel the same, apprehensive about the next time, always on the back of your mind?
  For those on Amiodarone what side affects do you feel. I get very fatigued.","Please see the web pages for more details on ICD and Amiodarone.
One problem with an ICD is that it sometimes delivers shocks when you do not need them. Even though a shock lasts a very short time, you can usually feel it. Every shock you feel should be notified to your doctor. The settings of the ICD may need to be adjusted or your medications may need to be changed.ICD problems can sometimes be prevented by programming the device to sound an alert when there is a problem. This can be done by your electrophysiologist. If you heart your ICD alert, you should immediately call your doctor.
WARNING: In June 2005, certain ICD models and biventricular pacemaker-defibrillators were recalled by the manufacturer because of a circuitry flaw that prevents the devices from delivering therapeutic electrical shocks when needed. The problem may result in patient death. Two deaths are believed to be associated with the malfunction. Although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration did not make any specific recommendations, the agency encourages patients who may have such a device to ask their health care doctor if they should have it removed or replaced. The devices affected by this recall are:
    * PRIZM 2 DR, Model 1861, manufactured on or before April 16, 2002

I ended up in the emergency room and after an ultra sound, was told I was off to the operating room.

It has been a year and a half since she delivered a healthy little girl, but the pain and vomiting still persist. Has anyone out there ever gone through this and can you tell me what is going on. Its not her pancreas, galbladder, intestines or anything that the doctors can put a finger on.   Please help, we are desparate.","First, is your daughter taking any supplements or prescription medications - especially prescription ones?  When you are taking a prescription and complain about a possible side effect, most doctors won't believe you if your complaint is not one of those listed as a potential side effect  by the drug manufacturer.  Yet as we know, each body is different.  Therefore whatever you are experiencing could be a little known side effect.  When drug companies conduct clinical trials, they often don't report findings that are less than .5% of the test population.  If you happen to be part of that .5%, however, you know that what you experienced is very real, indeed.

Nausea and vomiting were not listed as possible side effects, but on the advice of my mother and under the care of my physician, I quit taking the medicine in question.  In only three days, the problem was resolved.

If your daughter's problem cannot be tied to a medication or supplement she is ingesting, my next question would be whether or not she has seen an allergist.  Some food allergies can cause nausea and vomiting.  Of course, there are usually accompanying symptoms like edema or rash if that it the case.

A final question would be whether your daughter has been evaluated by an endocrinologist?  I had a friend whose daughter suffered for years with a similar problem before finally being diagnosed with a digestive disorder.  She now eats five small meals daily, has eliminated certain foods from her diet completely  and limits consumption of other foods to a fraction of what she used to eat.  She has been pain and nausea -free for four or five  years.

Medicine is not an exact science.  Generally, a diagnosis is reached either by determining what is NOT going on or on the assumption if X number of people experiencing what you're experiencing have Y disease, then by default that must be what you have.  

Unfortunately, not every ailment is easily diagnosed.  Furthermore, some diseases mimic other diseases so even when you get a diagnosis it can be incorrect.

I realize it is frustrating to continue seeking medical advice, but your best line of defense it to continue to seek help until someone comes up with the right diagnosis.  And if you have not seen an allergist or an endocrinologist, by all means get your daughter to consult one.  It's her body.  She must  i n s i s t  the doctors continue to evaluate her specifics until they figure out what is wrong! 

By offering your situation in this forum, it may be someone will have experienced the same thing and with the information they provide you, you will be armed for the next trip to the doctor.  You are doing all the right things by being PROactive where your daughter's health is concerned.  Hang in there because there IS an answer.  You simply have to continue to search until you find it.","pregnancy, pain and vomiting",,,,,,,,"It has been a year and a half since she delivered a healthy little girl, but the pain and vomiting still persist.",pain and vomiting still persist,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Has anyone out there ever gone through this and can you tell me what is going on.,,Yes:  You are doing all the right things by being PROactive where your daughter's health is concerned. ,,,

64,2842187,Question About Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.?,"I know that this is not a medical community but perhaps someone here will have information on this for me.  Opinions are also helpful.

10 years ago my b/f was in a car accident with 2 friends and he was the only survivor. Although he was not the driver in the accident he has suffered from PTSD and completely stopped driving. Since that time he has tried driving a few times but each time he tries he has so much stress that he vomits afterward (sorry for being gross) and does not look forward to trying again. 

Now he has just started an awesome job and is very excited.  We both agree that with the field he is working in it would be very good for him to be able to drive again. 

So last week he started his new job driving on his own, about 20 min. each way but is having a hard time - getting sick and stressed.

Its only been 8 days but I'm worried that this is hurting him more than helping him. Has anyone dealt with this? Do you think he might get better?  What should he do?","If you have not experienced PTSD, it's hard to explain the feeling.  If you know any older citizens who served in the Gulf War,  Vietnam War or even World War II, for instance, you can ask them about being ""shell shocked"", or PTSD.  For some people it never goes away.  I know from experience (an almost fatal auto accident that crippled me and took my professional life away at no fault of my own) that it's still there, under the surface, after 5 years.  However, I made myself get in the car and deal with it.  I think your b/f is on the right track and I'm impressed that he's willing to face his greatest fears.  You go ahead and encourage him every way you can and let him be a man and have a full life again without being co-dependent on anyone else.  He doesn't need to be an emotional cripple. What would he do if you weren't there to drive him??  He'll be proud of himself before long.  A pat on the back goes a long way.  So he might have stressful moment or two; he can learn to deal with it and get stronger and should continue to get professional help as long as he needs it.  He probably is feeling guilty as hell because he lived; not to mention every thing else involved.  Let him go...give him a nudge and hold him when he needs it.  Encourage him to help others with this problem.  Helping is great healing therapy for him and others.  He'll be living with this for a long time.

66,3724314,Tattoo anxiety?,"I've have a small butterfly on my lower back/hip area for 5 years now but for some reason I've started getting anxious about it.

Could I be misplacing my anxiety about other things onto the tattoo?  I'm very happy in life at the moment.

Any ideas appreciated :)","""I'm very happy in life at the moment.""

I think you may be experiencing something my cousin goes through. When her life is running smoothly; no confusion, no heartaches, no financial issues etc.. She will always find something to obsess about. She once said to me; ""I think I am freaking out because there is nothing wrong with my life now and it is like I am waiting for something to happen. Life can't be this good for long!"" It is like she is waiting for something to foul up the comfort zone she has found herself in. She will ""look"" for something to be worried about. ""I should not have bought that coat!"" ""This is the worst haircut I have ever had!"" So on and so on. Maybe you find yourself in a place in life where all is well and yet you really don't think you ""deserve"" it to be. I believe a lot of people feel this way at some point in life to a certain degree.

Maybe you never really wanted the ink and now your subconscious is playing on your mind. However;  there could be much more going on. Maybe a visit to the Doc is not a bad idea.

I hope i can help, i had a car crash 4 year ago, wrote off my car and the other persons car, i was driving, not my fault it takes a long time to come to terms with this kind of thing.  it is called post traumatic stress.  

A few sessions with counceling will not help, it is a long process and you need to keep going.  you can e mail me if you wish to talk about it, I am not a councelor but It may help to talk to others.

I tried to avoid the crash but could not avoid what was going to happen, luckily no one was killed just serious whiplash and a few bruises and pains.  Time heals even now I have never forgot about it but more come to accept it as unavoidable and thank the lord no one lost life that day.  I still get nervouse in traffic when I drive and it has had an impact on me as a driver but I just try to move on and it gets easier.   Fell free to mail me if you want some one to chat with it may help.  

Please consider going back to psychiatrist and give it a fair chance to work.  first few sesions is about getting to klknow you  and building up a trust with them before you will commit to talking to them I say possibly about 4 to 6 months before you feel better there.

She worries about completely irrational things, she says she doesn't have any money (she has a ton of money in the bank) and can't afford groceries, she thinks people are planning to rob her or attack her, etc....We got her to go to her psychiatrist, and he prescribed Zyprexa, Zanax (sp?), and Depakote, but they don't seem to be working.  She has been taking these medicines for a month now, and she hasn't had any improvement.  She absolutely refuseds therapy and hospital care.  What are your experiences with bipolar disorder, and what can I do for my grandmother?","I am also bipolar, and very knowledgeable about the illness.. The doctor always knows best but has no real chance of being in a position to help if he has to make guesses at her condition. 
I am thinking that perhaps her bipolar disorder may have morphed into a more serious combination of many different afflictions as a result of her age and the traumatic loss of her life partner..
Find a way to speak with her doctor or psychiatrist and explain the finer details of her actions.. she may not be honest with him because of the paranoia of how he might try to help.. might be schizophrenia, dementia, post traumatic stress disorder.. or even being bipolar with new tendencies (it gets much worse over time, especially when treatment is abandoned and she stops the meds) 
look into these possibilities. Doctors know best, always.. but they need your help to be effective, especially in your grandmothers case.. when she isn't being very cooperative and taking a much more proactive approach towards her own wellbeing. She needs her medicine.. and she needs your help to get this under control. It seems that she is in a bad spot with being so mixed up in all of the emotions of what is happening all around her. Powerlessness is a horrible thing.. it seems she desperatly needs a helping hand. 
Educate yourself to whatever the possibilities for her behavior might be in a clinical sense so you can be helpful to the doctors. 
Do your part to get her the help she needs.

81,1502483,Is this normal?,"Is this normal? The last two days I have had hard bowel movements that have caused me to bleed. I am a 25 year old female and weigh 115 pounds (and no I am not menstruating).  I usually have normal bowel movements, and I also have IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) which causes a soft stool and more frequent bowel movements than normal. I have IBS as a result of having E-coli in 2000 (the Walkerton, Ontario Canada E-coli disaster) I�m sure you heard about it on the news. The whole town had bloody diarrhea. 

Anywho, that was the last time I had blood in my stool. However, I do not think that I have E-coli right now, but because I did have it before it raises some concern. I do not believe I have e-coli because when I did have it I had horrible cramping and bloody diarrhea. Right now, the last two days I have had no cramping, my stool is hard and the blood I don�t think is actually in my stool, I think it is the direct result of my hard bowel movement. Anyways, the question that I am asking is, is this normal? Has anyone else experienced this? And what is your opinion on my condition? Is this a result of not enough exercise or something that I ate or something else? Should I be concerned?

- Worried.","Don't worry too muvh!
A friend had the same concern recently.But it's not too serious, as you said, he was told the blood was due to stressing to pass the stool.But he was advised to avoid future occurrences as it can become serious if you develop hemorrhages inside(due to the straining).
I think you should begin to drink lots of water and high fibre to prevent the problem escalating, as the doc advised him.

And humans make errors.  It is a known fact that the average delay in diagnosis of Endometriosis is 9 long years and takes over 5 physicians before a woman is given an answer to her pain.  Years of suffering in silence and being told it is in her head is a matter of course for most women and girls with Endo.  Therefore, you really need to be an empowered patient and educate yourself so that you can make the best choices for your case based on factual, timely information.  

It is wonderful to have a caring doctor in whom you have placed your trust, but doctors are not God and it is a known fact that there exists a disproportionate amount of erroneous info among many docs concerning this disease.  Just because someone is nice or means well, doesn't mean they can effectively treat the disease.

That said, there is an abundance of evidence-based and current info available in lay terms at www.endocenter.org.  You may wish to also speak with others by joining this support group at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/erc.

There is no definitive cure for Endometriosis, and a lot of the treatments are only temporarily, if it all, effective (and most come with side effects).  Your best bet is to find a surgeon who truly understands and treats only Endometriosis; surgical removal such as through excision can often afford an extremely high success rate for long-term relief and resolve of symptoms (versus medical therapy or superficial surgery like ablation, vaporization and other similar methods).  See www.centerforendo.com for more info on that.

You do not have to suffer.  While there is no cure, there are ways in which you can live well despite the disease.  Take an active role in your healthcare and you will do well.  Get the new book, ""Living Well with Endometriosis..."" by Kerry Ann Morris (available at all bookstores and Amazon.com).  It is highly regarded in the Endo community and applauded by many healthcare professionals.

You are going to really regret it, if you ignore it, and it ends up being a cancer that could have been treated earlier.  Remember, you are talking about your BALLS.  You only get two of them, so you have to be diligent.  Talking to your parents can be awkward, but I am sure they would rather err on the side of caution.  If you absolutely cannot talk to your parents, call Planned Parenthood.  They do offer reproductive medical exams for men  and they provide it on a low/no fee scale.

With an abscessed tooth, the infection can spread to the nerve which is what causes so much pain.  It sounds like the infection may have spread outside the gingiva.

If I move any part of my body it is horrible pain. I have injections I take for this. But now that i'm pregnant I cant take anything and my dr is a bitc* because If you haven't experienced this for your self it's not possible to know the pain. Does anyone know what I can do that will help me? Maybe something natural or whatever Just to make it go away. If you haven't experienced this please don't give me a stupid answer. My sister has told me that child birth is less painful than a full blown migraine. She gets them very seldom. I get them everyother day. Does or did anyone have the same problem?,"There's good news and there's bad.  The bad news is that having Migraines while pregnant IS horrible!  The good news is that a lot of pregnant woman find that their Migraines decrease or even disappear while pregnant.  This relief often carries through to breastfeeding and some women never experience a Migraine ever again.

You didn't say whether your doctor is your OB-Gyn or not.  Regardless, if you think your doctor is a bitc* and you don't like her, fire her!   You do not work for her.  She works for you and you pay her for her services.  You or your insurance company will be paying her a lot to deliver your child.  You deserve the best medical care for you and your unborn child and there's no reason why you have to continue seeing someone that you don't like or TRUST. 

If you don't have a doctor or a neurologist that treats your headaches, you should find one.  In case you don't know, there are doctors that limit their practice to headache treatment only.  They are called Headache Specialist.  You may be able to find one in the directory below.  This directory is ""...based on either first-hand recommendations by their patients or recommendations by other specialists with whom we have established relationships.""
http://headaches.about.com/od/recommendedspecialists/

[**Remember, before starting anything new, you should always discuss it with you doctor first.]
To help you get through the Migraine attacks, you might want to check into a complementary therapy(ies).  These alternatives may not abort a Migraine but it may help to ease it.  Some of these therapies include, massage, Acupuncture, Biofeedback, relaxation and/or visualization therapy, ice and/or heat packs, and aromatherapy, 

Of course it's best to be medication-free while you're pregnant.  This does not mean that there are no medications that can be taken during your pregnancy.  Dr. Lawrence Robbins, one of the top 10 headache medication experts in the US, has some great information on his website.  This excerpt from his book Headache Help discusses options including some medications that may possibly be used during pregnancy.  
http://www.headachedrugs.com/archives/pregnancy.html
Printing this out and taking it with you to discuss with your doctor at your next visit may be a good idea.  Another idea is to ask your OB-Gyn to contact the doctor who treats your Migraines and maybe the 3 (Yes, I did say THREE) of you come up with a Migraine management plan TOGETHER.

Lastly, Migraine is not a just a bad headache.  It's not caused by too much stress (although stress can exacerbate it)  or other emotional issues.  It is a real genetic neurological disease that there is no cure for.   Migraines can be completely disabling and the pain can be the worst you've ever experienced in your entire life.  It's is very important to remember that Migraine pain lasting more than 72 hours with less than a solid 4 hours relief can be dangerous and should be considered an emergency requiring an doctor visit or or a trip to the emergency room.","pregnancy, migraines",,Female,,horrible pain,migraines,,,,,dr is a bitc*,If you haven't experienced this for your self it's not possible to know the pain.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Does anyone know what I can do that will help me?

Three months after I gave birth I had surgery. So now I'm in remission. My daughter saved my life. If I didn't get pregnant I would have never gone to the doctor and would have been dead 5 years later.  So my point is no matter how miner it may seem now if it keeps going on it hurts for a reason.

He had horrible mouth pain. He went to the dentist and they took x-rays and told him he didn't have an absest.  They gave him antibotics and tylonel with codene and sent him out the door.  He said that he has since gone back for more meds.  He said no, I asked if they took any blood work he said no.  Well yesterday I got a frantic call from his friend that he has falen like 5 times yesterday and couldn't get up.  Me and my children stayed the night with him to help him out.  He said yesterday he only had a glass of milk because it hurts to chew and swallow.  He had been eating soip preraid in the blender.

She does not live with me, and I haven't witnessed this. 2-3 years ago she was put on Concerta for ADD, and since then she hasn't had much of an appetite. She rarely eats, and then it is not much. She says she is fat constantly (although she only weighs 89 pds. but I am extremely thin too) and she idolizes skeleton thin people.

42,1900628,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder?,"Does anyone have any experience with scrupulosity (form of OCD where the sufferer has persistent feelings of sinfulness and guilt)?

I was brought up in a Christian family, but now have a feeling of deep rooted guilt and sinfulness.....a belief that I'm a bad person and that I don't deserve forgiveness. As a consequence, I frequently self harm as a punishment for being a ""bad person"". I don't know whether what I am feeling is ""normal"" or if it's possibly scrupulosity.

How do I deal with this? Has anyone experienced anything similar and got over it? 

I should probably add that I have no intentions of leaving the Christian church.....I want to be able to accept God's love and forgiveness, but something is stopping me.

Oh yeah.......and I also have problems with depression and anxiety which I'm being treated for at the minute. I don't know whether this is all tied in or not.","I have A LOT of experience with this. I do not have OCD but my husband does and his has to do with such thoughts and horrible feelings of guilt. We are also devoted Christians and church members. He gets through most of it with a lot of support from his family and with professional therapy. This is not something that is going to just go away you have to work on it every day. First you have to know that when Jesus died on the cross he didn't say ok I forgive every one but you. You deserve it just as much as anyone else. Even He forgave those who put him on the cross. You need to pray and be thankful of this everyday. Speak to God as your constant companion in everything you do and you feel the difference. He is your Father and loves you as such. Second try to find a counselor you are comfortable with that you can express you thoughts and feelings to so you can stop the cycle of thoughts roaring in your head. It also helps if you can write them down, make sure you write all of them down. You don't ever have to read them again and you can destroy the pages if you like but you should still write down your thoughts. 

Finally and this is important, we learned after several years of bad doctors and wrong medications that a heart condition can cause and worsen this problem. Its called mitral valve prolapse and it messes up the autonomic system so that your chemistry is never normal. You should be check out for this as your heart can get worse with time and sometimes a beta blocker used for high blood pressure can help with your thoughts. Until you do get your heart checked out be sure to stay away from any mental health drugs because this condition also alters their effects.

I know the obivous answer is ""see a doctor"", but currently I live in a consertative Muslim country where STD testing is not very common and is generally frowned upon.  

I do have the option of going to a private hospital, but they tend to be very expensive. If need be, I will pay what ever is necessary, but is there anyway I can do a self diagnosis?

Is it possible this could be something else?","If it's just one, it's probably not genital warts. They tend to come in clusters and will spread around your penis. The solution is to have then burned off with liquid nitrogen. This can take several treatments, and if they aren't all removed they may re-occur.

Other symptoms that are sometimes confused as genital warts are molluscum contagiosum (another sexually transmittable disease) and fordyce spots (not a disease at all.)

The best thing to do is see a doctor ASAP. Only a doctor can provide an accurate diagnosis. If the private hospital is your only option, then go there. But it's better to know the truth, and if treatment is neccesary to start early.

It's much healthier to commit to a support group. I'm sure there are hotlines you can call for the nearest group that meets in your area.  Check those out.  

You may want to include some form of physical activity into your daily schedule, even if some days you will not carry them out.  Reward yourself when you do with something you like.

Think of some of your positive qualities.  Write them down and stick them in places you can see to read back to yourself, then run them thruough your mind a few times a day, even if you dont feel like it.  You need reprogramming while depressing.

Be selective about tv, stay away from news and others (eg, comedy sitcoms, talk shows, spy movies, ....), music, and be aware of other environmental noise elements so you can either avoid them or else minimise the effects.  Just as well, the Internet is not always so wholesome to be in (info overload).  Whatever it is, you need to examine your immediate environment and remove/minimise anything that bothers you a lot.  

When you find yourself analysing stuff too much, find something else to do.  Change the way you walk home from work/school, take a dif route, even if it's longer.  You need to get out from the routine of doing things.  Modify your diet a little.  

These are just some ways you may reduce the effects of outward routine, so your mind may find dif channels to park in.  Nothing ever changes overnight.  Be patient with yourself and with others.  Laugh a little, cartoons are great for that.

I am however having a completely different problem today and it started yesterday while I was deep cleaning my mom's house.  The stabbing pain is on the left side of my back ranging from my shoulder blade down to my kidney.  I also have the same pain in my right shoulder (from the top to my neck).  The pain is tingly and stabbing at the same time.  When I move the pain changes and I can get into a position where I don't feel it at all.

After doing that for a while (3-4 days, I guess), I would break a tablet into tiny crumbs, and I would take just enough of the crumbs for the shocks to subside.

Social Services really cheese me off when it comes to Dementia or Alzheimers problems!  

Alzheimers groups allow the wife to attend meetings where practical help is offered and the husband can go to and will be looked after by volunteers outside of the meeting.

He is also entitles to go to a day centre where specialist help will be available, lunch etc and it will give the wife a break.

I suppose the Dr burst an abscess.  These are full of pus; blood and white blood cells.  They often stink badly, due to containing anaerobic bacteria, and their waste products.

Many places in and on our bodies are normally inhabited by anaerobic bacteria, and they can be fine, if they stay in the right place.  If they get into bad places, they can lead to abscesses forming, but these burst, and then all is OK ... eventually.

Occasionally, we need help from antibiotics, to get rid of these bacteria from places they should not live in.

I decided when I was 33 (I am now 41)that I was not going to live like that anymore. Most of the time my ""buttons get pushed"" is when he has had a few drinks and starts to be a complete idiot. My spouse is also selfish, inconsiderate and so narrowminded he refuses to try to educate himself on certain issues. That is his choice and if you think you can change someone else, you know that won't happen. Change comes from within and it looks like you are trying for that goal. Asking others is fine, but going into depth requires a good friend that is near you every day and has the patience to listen and not give the advice for you to leave your spouse. GOOD LUCK. 

PS. I do not believe in venting to others on the internet as I have seen it make people dwell and hold anger. The people that I know that have done that get more angry, more often. Yes, you could have an allie, but that allie could be in worse shape than you and will hold you back from advancing your progress.

I don't know if you've ever tried meditation or anything spiritual, but if you are open-minded, you can find a LOT of books that can help you, as well as self-help support groups which can give you some input (you'll need to contact some counseling service or look in the phone book to find them).  
If your situation gets really bad, you may need to go to the emergency room at your local hospital (if you're contemplating some drastic action, they HAVE to help you); just take the insurance that you had from where you used to live. That should be enough for a hospital to use until your coverage gets switched over (even smaller hospitals have staff specialists that know how to deal with the money issue).

37,3836635,Treating ADD/ADHD without stimulants possible?,"My name is Brian and I�m 18 years old. I was diagnosed with ADHD about five years ago. I was placed on ritalin to treat my hyper-activity that was causing problems in school. The doctor changed my medicines for whatever reason I cannot remember to a drug known as 
Adderall XR� � with that in mind, not once do I recall myself being dependant upon ritalin but ever since the changing in medicines, I feel like life has come to a stop.

Adderall is also known as an AMPHETAMINE so for those of you wondering why it�s this addictive, it falls right underneath meth addictions. I just want to life a normal life, how do I win this battle by starting when I�m sober? ...","Hi Brian,

My name is Sarah and I have a degree in psychology, keep in mind that I am not a doctor however.  

Anyway, I think what you are going through is very common.  The first question that I'm wondering is why your doctor switched your medication?  I know that you said that you cannot remember but it might help you to ask.  Also, it's good that you know that taking that amount of pills is not a good idea.  Have you told anyone else about this?  A friend or family member?  My advice would be to tell someone (or just let them read your post) and have them go to the doctor with you on your next appointment and that way the truth will come out.  You should really let someone know about this before it's too late.  

As far as battling your ADHD, I do not think that medication alone works in most cases.  You should also seek counseling.  The two coupled together have a very high success rate as opposed to one in absence of the other.  It's just like depression, you can treat it with medication but there is still an underlying problem that contributes to it and until that problem is solved it will continue to come back.  

You seem to have a good head on your shoulders and I hope that you will seek help in others that are close to you.

Yes, a biopsy can be wrong.  Needle biopsy is not enough, you need an excision.  I'm puzzled why your bone marrow biopsy was normal, but your wbc was 1.5.  Your symptoms are certainly consistent with lymphoma.  Listen to your oncologist.

I do want to add, you can request your biopsy slides to be sent for a 2nd opinion.  Mayo clinic, for example.

Well, I'm not a doctor but I have to say if I were you I would have another biopsy done, and not just FNA (fine needle aspiration).  My personal feeling is if something isn't supposed to be there, TAKE IT OUT!!  I'm not sure where you live, but please go to a major medical center in your area.  I'm not sure why one MRI would show enlarged lymph nodes all over, but then you say CT, MRI, etc. ""all ok""  What are your liver enzymes?  Have you seen a nephrologist?

They range from dark patches on the knees, skin tags, horrible cramping, out of control periods or no periods at all, dry brittle hair, and weight gain around the middle.

28,1550717,Is my grandmother showing signs of mental illness?,"She is in her 80's and she lies constantly.  It's getting worse all the time.  No one in the family is in need of any of her money but she acts like someone is after it.  Anytime she buys something new she makes up big elaborate lies about why she had to buy it, or else some story about how someone just gave her something for free.  She tells everyone she is broke when it is very obvious that she is not.  We can't figure out why she is doing this.  She even makes up stories for normal things like new shoes, or medical things like hearing aids.  What's going on with her?  She does see a doctor for regular check ups, but I don't know if he is aware of this behavior.  Is it something that the family should discuss with him or is it best to stay out of it?  She acts normal other than the lying, which seems to gradually get worse.  Is her money making her paranoid?","Sounds as though she is manifesting some paranoid symptoms, likely as a result of early dementia or some other organic brain disorder.  So long as she is able to conduct her affairs without affecting anyone else (except their irritation at her confabulated rationale), there is no action that needs to be taken.  Confabulation is often a mechanism that shows up when memory fails, and it may not be consciously that she is doing this.

But be on the alert for other signs, such as not paying bills/getting utilities cut off.  When her habits and behaviors become a danger to herself or others is when you need to intervene.",mental illness,,,,No one in the family is in need of any of her money but she acts like someone is after it. /We can't figure out why she is doing this.,grandmother,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Is it something that the family should discuss with him or is it best to stay out of it?

71,1724967,Does my 3 year old have Tourettes?,"A couple of days ago (about 6) my son started ""double blinking"" and it started after he hung out with his half uncle who has Tourettes. I don't know if he picked it up, if it is a nervous habit or if he really has Tourette. My husband is telling me not to worry about it because him and his brother don't have the same dad...and it is genetic. I have taken him to his pedatrician today and she pretty much refered me to a Neuroligist to check him out. If I let them give him an ECG (is that right?) will it definatley let me know if he has tourettes or is it pretty hard to discover? I think Im going to cancel the appt. and see what happens in a month or so. See if anyother tics have developed. Has anyone else ever dealt with this? What symptoms should I be watching for? Thanks for your help.","Tourettes is a Neurological disorder in the brain.  It is not contagious.  The conventional wisdom is that it is hereditary, but there has been recent genetic research that may suggest otherwise. (I have the info, please let me know if you'd like it).

Three is pretty early for symptoms to start, but not impossible.  My recommendation is keen observation, notes, and a video camera.  

An EEG is good, but not a determining factor in diagnosing Tourettes.  It will, however, rule out any seizure disorders, and that is important.  There is no ""one"" test for Tourettes.  It is diagnosed by observation in the Dr. office and your oral history.
DO THIS:  While he is playing alone and there are minimal distractions, video tape him without him knowing.  This will prevent him from ""hamming it up"" for the camera.  This information will help tremendously in the diagnostic process.  Your notes and observations will also be vital to the process.  We did this (video tape) with our son when the tics and vocal tremors were very obvious, just in case they were not present during the prescribed day and time of the appointment. 

Tourettes is difficult to diagnose in small children because it is difficult to know if the movements and/or sounds they are making are in their control.  And since he is so young, it would be difficult to ask him.  If you have referral a Pediatric Neurologist in your area, I would keep the appointment as an office/information visit.  Assuming the tics continue,  bring your video camera (to show that tape) and your husband with you.  For some reason, a Doctor will take a set of parents seriously and not attribute what you are saying to ""a hysterical mom"".   Start a relationship with this doctor.  This will help over the years.  

ABOVE ALL stay calm.  Having a child with Tourettes is not the worst thing in the world.  You will find this to be true when you spend any amount of time in a Pediatric Neurology waiting room.  And please ignore the stupid, uninformed, and rude answers that will come. Coprolalia (cursing) occurs in a VERY SMALL number of TS patients and is not a requirement for a diagnosis.

If your child has TS, the most important thing to do for him is to provide a safe, stress free (as much as possible) home environment where he is allowed to tic without comment from others.  Unconditional acceptance is imperative.

We got the diagnosis at age 9.  Symptoms really started to kick in at 7-8.  Little things started at 4.  He is now almost 12 and is doing great.  He is sweet, loving and a great kid.  He has a high IQ, plays chess, builds advanced Lego sets, makes stop-motion animation movies on his iMac and it artistically gifted.  I would not trade him for the world.  

You are blessed to have a Pediatrician who gives the referral to a Neurologist right away!  I had to switch pediatricians until someone listened!  My road to diagnosis was rocky.

I'm asking because my husband was cooking chicken and my daughter (who's 1_)  reached on the counter and grabbed a piece and licked it when he wasnt watching. he took it from her and told me what she did, so i flushed her mouth out and washed her hands vigarously with antibacterial soap. I am wondering because I'm scared and I dont know if I should go to the ER or wait til I see the symptoms.

I NEED SERIOUS ANSWERS ONLY! 
thanks","Hey, accidents happen and kids will be kids.  My two-year old gets into everything as well.

Just keep an eye on her for the next three days.  If she starts showing symptoms, then go to the doctor/ER.

Don't worry, she will probably be OK.

From Yahoo! Health:
""Symptoms of salmonellosis include diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps. They develop 12 to 72 hours after infection, and the illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. However, diarrhea and dehydration may be so severe that it is necessary to go to the hospital. Older adults, infants, and those with impaired immune systems are at highest risk.""",salmonella poisoning,,,,,,,,I am wondering because I'm scared and I dont know if I should go to the ER or wait til I see the symptoms.,salmonella poisoning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Let me say I AM NOT a bad mother, nor my husband a bad father.

If you can't sleep for whatever reason, then don't try.  I used to have insomnia, and when I realized I really could not get any sleep, I stopped trying to get sleep.  I got up, watched tv, read a book, did light house work.  And then after a few days, BAM! I was like a zombie.  I couldn't wait to hit the bed!  Sleep is a natural process that the body needs to regenerate and rest.  It is usually something on the mind, or a chemical imbalance of some sort that keeps us awake. 

 If restlessness lasts for more than a few days, then see a doctor. But first, try depriving yourself of sleep.

I am a 25 year old female and weigh 115 pounds (and no I am not menstruating).  I usually have normal bowel movements, and I also have IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) which causes a soft stool and more frequent bowel movements than normal. I have IBS as a result of having E-coli in 2000 (the Walkerton, Ontario Canada E-coli disaster) I�m sure you heard about it on the news. The whole town had bloody diarrhea. 

Anywho, that was the last time I had blood in my stool. However, I do not think that I have E-coli right now, but because I did have it before it raises some concern. I do not believe I have e-coli because when I did have it I had horrible cramping and bloody diarrhea. Right now, the last two days I have had no cramping, my stool is hard and the blood I don�t think is actually in my stool, I think it is the direct result of my hard bowel movement.

And humans make errors.  It is a known fact that the average delay in diagnosis of Endometriosis is 9 long years and takes over 5 physicians before a woman is given an answer to her pain.  Years of suffering in silence and being told it is in her head is a matter of course for most women and girls with Endo.  Therefore, you really need to be an empowered patient and educate yourself so that you can make the best choices for your case based on factual, timely information.  

It is wonderful to have a caring doctor in whom you have placed your trust, but doctors are not God and it is a known fact that there exists a disproportionate amount of erroneous info among many docs concerning this disease.  Just because someone is nice or means well, doesn't mean they can effectively treat the disease.

That said, there is an abundance of evidence-based and current info available in lay terms at www.endocenter.org.  You may wish to also speak with others by joining this support group at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/erc.

There is no definitive cure for Endometriosis, and a lot of the treatments are only temporarily, if it all, effective (and most come with side effects).  Your best bet is to find a surgeon who truly understands and treats only Endometriosis; surgical removal such as through excision can often afford an extremely high success rate for long-term relief and resolve of symptoms (versus medical therapy or superficial surgery like ablation, vaporization and other similar methods).  See www.centerforendo.com for more info on that.

You do not have to suffer.  While there is no cure, there are ways in which you can live well despite the disease.  Take an active role in your healthcare and you will do well.  Get the new book, ""Living Well with Endometriosis..."" by Kerry Ann Morris (available at all bookstores and Amazon.com).  It is highly regarded in the Endo community and applauded by many healthcare professionals.

I think you may be experiencing something my cousin goes through. When her life is running smoothly; no confusion, no heartaches, no financial issues etc.. She will always find something to obsess about. She once said to me; ""I think I am freaking out because there is nothing wrong with my life now and it is like I am waiting for something to happen.

Maybe you find yourself in a place in life where all is well and yet you really don't think you ""deserve"" it to be.

I hope i can help, i had a car crash 4 year ago, wrote off my car and the other persons car, i was driving, not my fault it takes a long time to come to terms with this kind of thing.  it is called post traumatic stress.  

A few sessions with counceling will not help, it is a long process and you need to keep going.  you can e mail me if you wish to talk about it, I am not a councelor but It may help to talk to others.

I tried to avoid the crash but could not avoid what was going to happen, luckily no one was killed just serious whiplash and a few bruises and pains.  Time heals even now I have never forgot about it but more come to accept it as unavoidable and thank the lord no one lost life that day.  I still get nervouse in traffic when I drive and it has had an impact on me as a driver but I just try to move on and it gets easier.   Fell free to mail me if you want some one to chat with it may help.  

Please consider going back to psychiatrist and give it a fair chance to work.  first few sesions is about getting to klknow you  and building up a trust with them before you will commit to talking to them I say possibly about 4 to 6 months before you feel better there.

good luck and be happy you are alive to tell the tale, many do not make it and we should all celebrate life and live each day as if it were our last because one day it will be.

26,1869533,tourette's syndrome myths and misconceptions?,"I have just read about the infamous comments made by Dr Laura about tourettes on the occcasion of a caller asking if she should invite a person with tourettes to a wedding.

It really bothers me that everyone thinks it's a ""cursing disease."" (Thanks so much, LA Law and Ally McBeal). Less than 10% of people with TS have copralalia.

Also, it's very hard for people to understand that the condition ebbs and flows. Not just the tics, but the ADHD and obsessive-compulsive symptoms that tend to come with it.

28,2336132,Implanted Cardiac Defibrillator?,"Four years ago I had an episode where I went into V-Tac, the paramedics had to jolt me with their mobile defibrillator to get my heart back into normal rythum.
  At the hospital it was determined I needed an implanted defibrellator to controle any further problems. they also put me on the medication Amiodarone which is a antiarrithmic.
 Last year I had a episode where the unit discharged five times about one minute apart, felt like getting hit in the chest with a sledge hammer.
  After that episode I feel a bit anxious about the next time this may accour, believe me Im not looking foreward to it.
  Are there other people that feel the same, apprehensive about the next time, always on the back of your mind?
  For those on Amiodarone what side affects do you feel. I get very fatigued.","Please see the web pages for more details on ICD and Amiodarone.
One problem with an ICD is that it sometimes delivers shocks when you do not need them. Even though a shock lasts a very short time, you can usually feel it. Every shock you feel should be notified to your doctor. The settings of the ICD may need to be adjusted or your medications may need to be changed.ICD problems can sometimes be prevented by programming the device to sound an alert when there is a problem. This can be done by your electrophysiologist. If you heart your ICD alert, you should immediately call your doctor.
WARNING: In June 2005, certain ICD models and biventricular pacemaker-defibrillators were recalled by the manufacturer because of a circuitry flaw that prevents the devices from delivering therapeutic electrical shocks when needed. The problem may result in patient death. Two deaths are believed to be associated with the malfunction. Although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration did not make any specific recommendations, the agency encourages patients who may have such a device to ask their health care doctor if they should have it removed or replaced. The devices affected by this recall are:

40,1145364,Is anyone scared that advances in medicine will make humans weaker in the long run?,"When a person before the age of ""modern medicine"" say 1900 or so had a terminal illness, natural selection and the absense of a cure would cause that particular person to die prematurely, in which case, they could not pass their defect or disease on to any offspring (if they didn't have any yet).

Now, medicine has evolved to where we are keeping people with serious diseases such as depression, diabetes, asthma, etc alive with drugs.

This hits on a personal note because I have serious asthma and probably would have died before the age of 5 if there wasn't today's medicine. Now I am worried about passing that on to any children I might have, and I'm considering not having any due to this and some other conditions I have, such as degenerated discs in my back at the age of 15. I'm 28 now....

My feeling is that the reason health care costs are astronomical is because each person has more problems today because we aren't weeding out the weak or defective.

Opinions?","if the theory of evolution holds, it's not humans who are getting weaker but the viruses are getting stronger. for each remedy we conjure or every treament we find, it may cure the ailment then, but eventually, stronger viruses evolve to overcome the treatments and drugs. Much like cockroaches, diseases come and go but always get stronger in the end. So there are more needs for stronger medicines to confront them. it may be that it may weaken the indivdual. The abundance of one cell leads to a shortage of another which is why people may appear to be getting more ailments than usual. I believe overall that medicine today is helping us live longer and better for the most part. And in the end, there's no money in curing diseases, only in treating them.",medicine,25-34 years old,,,,,,,"Now I am worried about passing that on to any children I might have,",asthma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Now I am worried about passing that on to any children I might have,",,,,,Yes:  I believe overall that medicine today is helping us live longer and better for the most part.,,,

50,107231,concerning my daughter?,"it all started when she was 2 months pregnant. the nauseas feeling, even throwing up. But there was also excruciating pain in the stomach. it got so severe that she ended up spending most of the pregnancy in the hospitals with a demerol drip. she has been to all the hospitals in the area plus some that are 50 miles away. Given all the test that the doctors can imagine. Her veins colapsed from all the needles. no one can figure out what is going on. It has been a year and a half since she delivered a healthy little girl, but the pain and vomiting still persist. Has anyone out there ever gone through this and can you tell me what is going on. Its not her pancreas, galbladder, intestines or anything that the doctors can put a finger on.   Please help, we are desparate.","First, is your daughter taking any supplements or prescription medications - especially prescription ones?  When you are taking a prescription and complain about a possible side effect, most doctors won't believe you if your complaint is not one of those listed as a potential side effect  by the drug manufacturer.  Yet as we know, each body is different.  Therefore whatever you are experiencing could be a little known side effect.  When drug companies conduct clinical trials, they often don't report findings that are less than .5% of the test population.  If you happen to be part of that .5%, however, you know that what you experienced is very real, indeed.

I recently underwent a host of tests for recurrent nausea and vomiting.  My mother asked me about medications I was taking and  immediately homed in on one of my medications as one she had been unable to take.  Nausea and vomiting were not listed as possible side effects, but on the advice of my mother and under the care of my physician, I quit taking the medicine in question.  In only three days, the problem was resolved.

If your daughter's problem cannot be tied to a medication or supplement she is ingesting, my next question would be whether or not she has seen an allergist.  Some food allergies can cause nausea and vomiting.  Of course, there are usually accompanying symptoms like edema or rash if that it the case.

A final question would be whether your daughter has been evaluated by an endocrinologist?  I had a friend whose daughter suffered for years with a similar problem before finally being diagnosed with a digestive disorder.  She now eats five small meals daily, has eliminated certain foods from her diet completely  and limits consumption of other foods to a fraction of what she used to eat.  She has been pain and nausea -free for four or five  years.

Medicine is not an exact science.  Generally, a diagnosis is reached either by determining what is NOT going on or on the assumption if X number of people experiencing what you're experiencing have Y disease, then by default that must be what you have.  

Unfortunately, not every ailment is easily diagnosed.  Furthermore, some diseases mimic other diseases so even when you get a diagnosis it can be incorrect.

I realize it is frustrating to continue seeking medical advice, but your best line of defense it to continue to seek help until someone comes up with the right diagnosis.  And if you have not seen an allergist or an endocrinologist, by all means get your daughter to consult one.  It's her body.  She must  i n s i s t  the doctors continue to evaluate her specifics until they figure out what is wrong! 

By offering your situation in this forum, it may be someone will have experienced the same thing and with the information they provide you, you will be armed for the next trip to the doctor.  You are doing all the right things by being PROactive where your daughter's health is concerned.  Hang in there because there IS an answer.  You simply have to continue to search until you find it.",pain in the stomach,,Female,,Her veins colapsed from all the needles./ desparate,no one can figure out what is going on. / pain and vomiting still persist,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Has anyone out there ever gone through this and can you tell me what is going on,,"Yes: First, is your daughter taking any supplements or prescription medications - especially prescription ones? / I had a friend whose daughter suffered for years with a similar problem before finally being diagnosed with a digestive disorder / I realize it is frustrating to continue seeking medical advice, but your best line of defense it to continue to seek help until someone comes up with the right diagnosis.

55,422682,What is the correlation between low-income/poverty and obesity?,"I dont want to sound mean, but why are so many poor people or lower income people so FAT? Is it that they lack money to buy healthly foods or that they lack education about how to live a more healthy life? Does this lead to people believing that people are poor because they are lazy because it is easy to assume that fat people are lazy? Any idiot knows that being overweight is bad for you, so lacking the ivy league education is no excuse. And a plate of salad is just as available and cheap as a big mac, so it comes down to choice. If you look back in history, being fat was associated with WEALTH. Poor people were skinny and under nourished, royalty were fat and happy. Now this trend has reversed.....rich people somehow manage to stay skinny, and poor people get fatter by the moment. Whats going on?","Contrary to most people's opinion it's not the cost of food that's leads to high rates of obesity in low-income people.  It's the lack of education.  Most aren't educated about nutrition which leads to poor food choices.  If you go to your local supermarket and do a price comparison study (which I've done for a research project) you'll find that the cost of fruits, vegetables, whole wheat breads and pastas, and chicken are about equal to the cost of buying the ingredients to make some of these high calorie, low nutritious foods.  Because they lack knowledge about correction portion size, daily fat intake, starches they tend to make poor choices.  Most think a single serving means you eat one plate, which we all know to be incorrect. It also has to do with learned patterns. If they were raised in low income situations most of their recipes come from what they grew up on during a time when underprivileged people didn't really have a much, but found comfort in food.  Which is a Southern tradition big meals replaced expensive living.

65,768616,is wearing flip flops healthy for feet or not? please see my details?,"Hi. Like most girls at 17 I love wearing flip flops all the time but many articles say they are bad for your feet. I don't get it.

The anti-flipflop articles say that b/c flip flops lack arch support your feet may get fallen arches. However many websites that encourage bare feet (which I also do a lot but only indoors) say that going barefoot can HELP strengthen your feet and develop good arches.

See the contradiction? Going barefoot and flip flops both have no arch support but barefoot can ""tone your feet"" and flip flops will ""cause fallen arches"". It makes no sense. I think flip flops is the closest you can get to natural barefoot walking without dirty feet and risk injury/infection. Can someone explain? Thanks!

Oh if you are a girl and age 15-25 please also see my bf's question: http://answers.yahoo.com/question/;_ylt=Au9U2HuU2cmoOTC_5PKlUBsjzKIX?qid=20060618235316AAv8YbX
It's also about feet. Actually we're working together to make a statement to my brother so pls reply!","Having grown up in Hawaii at a time when it was common for many kids to go to school (and basically spend their whole lives) barefoot, I can attest to the fact that going barefoot, at least, can lead you to have a big oval-shaped flat foot.

But you are 17 years old, and your bones are already not soft and forming like a child's.  I don't think you have anything to worry about.  Besides, many shoes other than flip-flops have no arch support, and on top of that, you can buy flip flops that do have arch supports.

I went off the HCTZ on my own and the burning sensation went away. I knew it was from the med but he didn't. I have also vision changes. I told my doctor that I had some symptoms that diabetics have. I asked him if a blood test would show if I had diabetes. He said it does and then said my blood tests are fine. Then I got a letter from him telling me my glucose has improved. I was never told that my glucose was not normal. What does this letter mean? He has not asked me to make another appointment nor has he scheduled other tests for me.

I was going to wait to see if I got my period, which i did, but I know when you are on the pill, it is still possible to get your period.

you got yout period
and you dont experience symptoms till about 2 weeks after the egg implants itself. 

but if you didnt think you had a miscarriage then you should go tot he doc to see if anythign is left in there that could cause an infection that could lead to infertlity. but to me it just sounds like its side effects of the pill (if you are a few months new to it, your body is still adjusting, nausea, vomiting and breat tnderness are all side effects of the pill if you read the pamphlet.) never have unprotected sex either! the pill is not 100% effective and since you seem to not take them everyday then there is a decrease in effeciency of the pill protecting against pregnany. im on the pill and take it on time everyday and still use condoms even though i dont have to worry about std's cause we both lost ours to eachother, but we always use condoms just to protect against pregnancy just incase the condoms break the pill is really a back up method. 

go tot he doctor if you are still concerned. im sure you can talk tot he nurse and just get the answer over the phone but please prtect yourself! 

it is also if you are new to the pill that you bleed between periods. the symptoms of a miscarriage is heavy heavy bleeedin and severe cramps.

I also experienced a lot of pain in my shoulders and was told that is part of it. I found that if I stayed away from all fatty and fried foods I would feel a ""little"" better.  The attacks started becoming more frequent, it was like a band of pain around my back that was winding around to my solar plexus. When this happened, I was unable to lie down, sit up or anything else. I just couldn't get comfortable. The last attack came when I ate chili for dinner.  Wow! I ended up in the emergency room and after an ultra sound, was told I was off to the operating room. My Doctor told me it wasn't life threatening, the pain was from the gall bladder having spasms when the stone was blocking the bile which put me into almost a frenzy of pain.  I had the Old surgery, this was before the laproscopic surgery was around.  I lost 26 lbs through the ordeal as well.
Later, I met a friend who also had his gallbladder removed only his was gangerous!  If he didn't have surgery right away he would have died!  So it is nothing to fool around with, if you have another attack, go to the hospital for an ultra-sound where they will determine what needs to be done....in the meantime, plenty of fluids, rest as much as you can and be very careful what you eat.  Avoid spices, eat bland until this is taken care of.  I let mine go about a year and felt so good after that I am still shaking my head as to why I didn't do it sooner!

83,2505931,Did you know that some types of birth control cause a woman to have an abortion every month?,"This is a question for those who are pro-life in ALL instances of pregnancy.

Chemical methods of birth control are also linked to cancer
The ones that cause abortions are; Copper T IUD, Progestasert IUD, The Mini-Pill, The Morning After Pill, and of course RU-486, taken after implantation.

The ones that MAY cause abortions are; The Pill, Implants, Shots, Patches, and Vaginal Ring.

There are many methods of birth control that do not cause abortions (or cancer). They are called ""barrier methods"" and they include; abstinence, periodic abstinence (a.k.a. Rhythm Method), condom (male and female versions), diaphragm, cervical cap, Spermicides, and/or surgical sterilization. It is recommended that at least two of these be used at once, as they are still not foolproof. If one fails, the other one can help to cover the ""gaps"".

If you are firmly pro-life, do you believe that the abortifacient methods of birth control are wrong?

85,2834243,What is the best way to deal with mild to moderate depression that doesn't deal with anti-depresants(MAOI)?,"I have struggled with bouts of depression and isolation for as long as I can remember. I have seen the adverse affects of anti-depresants on my father and the way that he continued to struggle. I am a single man in my early 20's, who attends a university, and works for nearly everything he gets. I feel that there is always something missing and I;m getting tired of trying unsuccessfully to discover what it is. I have tried spirituality and I'm very active in my church but I feel unsatisfied. I have read extensively about depression and seasonal affective disorders and have come across too much information on the subject. I need the advice of you, the person reading this at this time. If you have suffered the affects of depression and have overcome without the use of perscription drugs-please tell me how you did it, or useful resourses that might help me. Thank you.","I understand your desire to stay away from ""sledgehammer"" solutions. When it comes to your health, remedies that are stronger are not always better. I have three things that have gotten me through times when I've been depressed, and they're all gentle solutions that I think will suit an intelligent person like yourself. 

1 - The first is what Freud calls the ""talking cure"". He insists that it must be performed by a psychoanalyst who you are paying for, but actually I've performed it by writing in a diary. The key is to be very honest, and try to find connections that you might otherwise be supressing, because these are the areas that need work. For example, what's the first thing that pops into your mind when you think of ""depression""? If the answer is ""flying a kite"", then follow the chain... What do you think of when you think of ""kite"" and ""flying""... You'll be surprised how quickly this takes you right down to an event in your childhood or an unresolved conflict that might have happened a year ago.

2 - Looking for lies. A chair cannot make you depressed. A lampshade cannot make you depressed. Only another person can make you depressed. I believe it is because a chair and a lampshade cannot lie. Only a person can lie. Depression, it seems to me, comes from believing a lie. That conflict (between reality and the lie) takes up so much mental energy to maintain, it drains you as a whole. You may find, after using technique #1, that it leads to you to this conclusion #2. For example, after free associating your way to an event, you might find that it was when someone told you that you weren't worth a hill of beans. The problem is not that they insulted you, the problem is that you believed the lie. Beware, giving up on a lie that we've believed in for a long time is tougher than it sounds.

3 - This one is going to sound goofy, especially after wading in deeply with the other two techniques. Get some light to shine on the cells in the back of your eyes.

92,4163018,"Cat scan or (CT), MRI Q's!?","In the past 3 months have had 2 CT's and MRI (all have been abdomen/pelvic because of an injury) whatare  the radiation levels, is it safe to have so many done.  Why do they make  you wear underwear (boxers and socks) in one CT scan and not in the other? Why do they make you take 2 hours of nasty tasting shakes.  After injecting the dye nurse said body will remain hot and feverish and not to do any extreme exercises, until how long?
Is it normal not to find arm/elbow and hand veins (even though they are quite visible) from which to inject the dye and therefore use the thigh vein? 
Is all this normal?
Other than that no other health issues like High BP, Diabetes, CHL, EKG perfect, heart rate was a stable 90 the whole time.
Any answers are appreciated, thanks.","there is very little radiation so don't worry there unless you are pregnant.  why you had your short on in one and not the other is only the way the person that took it preference,  You usually remove everything and only wear a gown.  as for the veins not all veins are use able and you may have veins that blow very easily. When inserting the dye they need a good vein you must not have them,,  Join the club.  I always have trouble even when I have a simple blood test taken.  Having it in your thigh sucks but it is the best vein.  I hope that they find what they are looking for and sometimes you may need to have a test repeated as they do not always show the true story.  I Have had kidney stones 5 times and ever time they have to do the Dye test and 4 times it came back negative and all 5 times I delivered a nice stone so the tests are not always right.  My nephew has recently been in and out of hospital for 5 months off work also.  they ran so many tests on him trying to find out what was wrong and then they finally found that he had Gull stones which should have showed up on the CT's Ultra sounds etc. but never until just recently.  He lost 34 lbs.  I wish you all the luck!!!!
The reason for the metal detector thing is becasue it is a metal that is put into your veins. It si usually gone in 48 hrs though so you would not beep unless you left the hospital and went right to the airport.",2 CT's and MRI,,,,,,,,,,Why do they make  you wear underwear (boxers and socks) in one CT scan and not in the other?

My period came 29 days after I miscarried( I was also on BC for a week in a half during that time). Since my period, I have been cramping off and on and it seemed like a few weeks ago I had pregnancy symptoms again. Sore underarms, some heartburn, dizziness...but that has all seemed to have gone away..even some nausea and headaches. ( I also have been suffering off and on from a sinus infection for the last few weeks). So now I am day 28 and no period. All I am getting is back pain..no cramping since this weekend and no sore breast..I keep thinking I am pregnant again...do you think I am just paranoid?? I have ovarian cysts as well.","It sounds as if you could be, but you can try an at home pregnancy test..( might want to wait just a few more days...or get an early detection test).and see your Doctor either way.

6,3087064,I need desperately need help?,"I used to self harm around the tome that I was using antidepressants. One of my teachers found out and told the counciler and they told my parents.At a regular medical check-up, my doctor told my mom that I seriously need psycological help. My mom did nothing. She didn't schedual an appointment for me to see someone after several reminders. Now I'm really freaked out because I stopped taking the antidepressants but there are still some left in the bottle. I just can't stop thinking about how it would be easy to swallow the rest of the pills and it might kill me. I've honestly just wanted to die lately. The only problem is if I try to get help, I'm afraid people will just think I'm trying to get attention, when that is NOT what I'm trying to do. I already my suicide note planned out, but like I said, it my suicide isn't complete, people will just think I'm looking for attention by the attempt. How am I supposed to get help?  Will someone please give me some much needed advice?","It is very common for people to feel guilty for asking for help. Many people feel like they are just trying to 'act sick for attention' or whatever.  I believe that you want help and think you need it. You are not acting and not just seeking attention even if that is what part of you might be whispering.  I don't know you, but it sounds like you are having a very awful time right now and I really do believe that you are of great importance to those around you even if that doesn't remotely seem true.  Heck, I happy to even have you here to be typing to you.  Death is just too final.  You are taking antidepressants so perhaps these feelings of suicide are coming from the mood disorder you are suffering from.  It is nothing to be ashamed of! many many people suffer from things like this.  Believe me that it can and will get better! This is just one phase of your life and you have so much more joy to confront as you continue to move through life.  Seek help.  Call up a help hotline, they can be very helpful.

Help is out there.  I hope i have done a bit to help you. It is not much, but I don't want you to keep the world from having someone as special as you.

Also, I don't know how old you are, but younger adolescents sometimes react poorly to antidepressants and it can make them suicidal.  Call up your doctor.  Find the number and just call him yourself if you don't think your mom will help.  This may or may not be the case, but something to ask your doctor about.

I will hope and pray that you will come to know how much of a joy you are to the world and that you will get past this and find out that this was a rough patch.... very rough.. but has passed.

19,4240244,"My friend didn't tell me , but pushed me away instead? I really need help?","My best friend and i have been inseprible for over 10 years now. She all of a sudden started pushing me away and not letting me go anywhere near her. she told me she hated me and never wanted to see me again. 
This hurt so much, and i was lost without her. she said so many hateful things to me, and i returned the favour to her. well after 1 month of not talking her mum called me and told me she was in the hospital and really really sick.

I went to the hospital and found she has cancer and wouldn't be alive much longer, she could barely talk. she told me that she pushed me away because she wanted me to get used to her not being there before she had to leave. She died the next day...

She was like a sister to me, and now I'll never get to see her again, why couldn't she just tell me, i feel so guilty about the things i said to her, how can i feel better about it? i just wish i could say sorry...","first of all, your friend was trying to protect you.  When things go wrong like that we as humans always seem to hurt the ones we love and those closest to us. maybe she was trying to safe you the pain and anguish of having to watch her die.and I am sure she was scared, both of dying and of how you might react.  It is always hard when a life ends with unfinished busines like this. I am sure if you knew the facts, then you would not have said these things to her, but i am sure she will forgive you.  WHen you went to the hospital did you tell her you did not mean what was said, as I am sure she appologised as well.  Only thing that can help is yourself, you have to accept that this was not under normal circumstances that this happened, and your friend did start by saying hurtful things to you.  People deal with things differently in life and this was her way off dealing with things.

Best advice I can give is for you to give it time, and if time is not the answer then find someone who you can talk to, a friend, doctor or a councilor.  Try going to her grave and talk to her tell her you are sorry.  Perhaps you can raise funds in her name for the cancer unit at the local hospital as away of easing the burden.  If you are a believer in psychics and mediums, then they can help you con5tact her or pass on a message.  my e mail address if you need to chat is trishaf2001@yahoo.co.uk drop me a line f you want and we can go to msn and chat there  hope this helps.  just remember the good times

Symptoms

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is much more than the normal anxiety people experience day to day. It's chronic and exaggerated worry and tension, even though nothing seems to provoke it. Having this disorder means always anticipating disaster, often worrying excessively about health, money, family, or work. Sometimes, though, the source of the worry is hard to pinpoint. Simply the thought of getting through the day provokes anxiety. 

People with GAD can't seem to shake their concerns, even though they usually realize that their anxiety is more intense than the situation warrants. People with GAD also seem unable to relax. They often have trouble falling or staying asleep. Their worries are accompanied by physical symptoms, especially trembling, twitching, muscle tension, headaches, irritability, sweating, or hot flashes. They may feel lightheaded or out of breath. They may feel nauseated or have to go to the bathroom frequently. Or they might feel as though they have a lump in the throat. 

Many individuals with GAD startle more easily than other people. They tend to feel tired, have trouble concentrating, and sometimes suffer depression, too. 

Usually the impairment associated with GAD is mild and people with the disorder don't feel too restricted in social settings or on the job. Unlike many other anxiety disorders, people with GAD don't characteristically avoid certain situations as a result of their disorder. However, if severe, GAD can be very debilitating, making it difficult to carry out even the most ordinary daily activities. 

GAD comes on gradually and most often hits people in childhood or adolescence, but can begin in adulthood, too. It's more common in women than in men and often occurs in relatives of affected persons. It's diagnosed when someone spends at least 6 months worried excessively about a number of everyday problems. 

Specific Symptoms of this Disorder:
Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance). 

The person finds it difficult to control the worry. 

The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months; children don't need to meet as many criteria). 


restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge 
being easily fatigued 
difficulty concentrating or mind going blank 
irritability 
muscle tension 
sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep) 
Additionally, the anxiety or worry is not about having a Panic Attack, being embarrassed in public (as in Social Phobia), being contaminated (as in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder), being away from home or close relatives (as in Separation Anxiety Disorder), gaining weight (as in Anorexia Nervosa), having multiple physical complaints (as in Somatization Disorder), or having a serious illness (as in Hypochondriasis), and the anxiety and worry do not occur exclusively during Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). 

The anxiety, worry, or physical symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. 

The disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism) and does not occur exclusively during a Mood Disorder, a Psychotic Disorder, or a Pervasive Developmental Disorder",axiety disorder,,,,I'm really distressed about this because it's hurting those around me.,axiety disorder,,,"I worry, construct senario's in my mind and then worry about what if.",axiety disorder,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I think I may have an axiety disorder, how do I know?",,,,,No,,,

I know your condition wasn't preeclampsia per se, but there are people on those bulletin boards who have had your experience.

I had preeclampsia in my first pregnancy. The BP came down to near normal within a few days of delivery. I also developed it during my second pregnancy, although not as badly. But after the birth, my BP kept going up. They ended up having to keep me an extra couple of days. But my daughter had a significant case of jaundice, so they kept her, too, and we all stayed together.

It is true that all pregnancies are different, and statistically, I believe, the odds are in your favor. So your story could have a happy ending.

32,2205997,Please help!!!! I am trying to understand ADD?,"I think I might have ADD and that I had it my whole life. I did few tests and all of them say I do. At the same time when I read books, I am sometimes not always convinced that this isa seperate Disorder. They say ADD people have a tendency to be addictive, they have low
self-esteem, disorganized, impulsive... That could be anybody with another mental illness.  I mean bipolar, Borderline Personalities.... can also have addictive tendencies, act on impulse, lack judjment... Many so called ""normal"" people are messy, lack organization... I am quite familiar with mental illness since I have few of them. I am just trying to understand when you have ADD, in what way your brain functions differently. What makes it so that you consider this a disorder. I am a bit confused. I would really love to hear from people who have the illness/insiders rather than to try to understand or interpret books on ADD. Please share your own experiences, I already have checked all the ADD websites. Thank you all.","I was diagnosed with AD/HD a few months ago and like you I was skeptical.  I have a few mental illnesses as well so many of the same questions were running around in my mind as well.  I think it's when you have a lot of the symptons.  I know people who are lazy and disorganized but that is because they choose to be.  AD/HD people just can't grab the concept.  We try our best to do it and it's a real struggle.  The one that hit me was the concentration one.  I say ignorance is bliss!  I could do three things at once and easily jump back and forth, if I got distracted I just happily went off to what ever distracted me and came back to what I was doing, if I couldn't remember what I was doing oh well!  After I was diagnosed I was trying really hard to write an email and was concentrating so hard to make sure I got everything in there that I needed too.  The phone kept going off and my YM messenger kept blinking and I was distracted and couldn't remember what I was doing!  It is frustrating when you know you have to try really hard to concentrate and you still can't!!

I realized I self medicated in school and still do! (In college)  I take a big soda with me into classes so I can stay focused.  If I don't have that caffeine I am fidgety and am unable to focus on what I need to.  My mind wonders.

The way I understand it, so far since I am still learning, is that our brains don't have the stimulators that everyone else does, at least not as many, and our minds are searching for outside stimulation to get what it needs.  That's why stimulators such as caffeine and ridolin have the opposite effect they give our brain the stimulation it craves and we are able to focus on what we need to other than it reving us up.

I haven't recieved any medications for AD/HD yet because I'm slightly apprehensive about it making me drowsy and I love the high energy that I have.  I believe that the high energy is just who I am as a person and the AD/HD just adds a little something to it.

I know many AD/HD people are highly creative and they go off their meds when they need to be creative.  I'm also afraid my creativity will suffer from it.

Over the past month or more he has gotten sick requently and thinking back it seems to be after drinking milk. Some told me he may have a milk allergy or be lactose intolerant. The thing is he eats cereal with milk in it, he eats cheese and yogurt, he also eats ice cream.

But you should probably bring it up with your pediatrician at your next visit.

I hope, for your son's sake, that it isn't anything serious.  I am lactose intolerant, and it's really annoying to have to check everything.  Lactose intolerence can actually start as a person gets older.  I didn't have a problem with dairy until I was almost seven.

The best advice I can give you for right now is to just make sure he's getting plenty of fluids (other than milk) and don't let him have any dairy for a while.

If they are not finding anything on scans, that is good news. 

The CA marker does not confirm anything.  A high result like yours can also be caused by an infection.  Benign conditions which can elevate CA 125 include infections of the lining of the abdomen and chest (peritonitis and pleuritis), menstruation, pregnancy, endometriosis, and liver disease. Benign tumors of the ovaries can also cause an abnormal test result. Because CA-125 can be high in many normal or benign conditions it is not useful as a screening test in large populations.

I think if something were malignant, it would be a higher result - over 60.

19,1522344,Acne mark/scars?,"I'm not sure what they are called, they're the ugly marks the zits leave behind after they're gone, and it's even harder to get rid of! I have TONS of these on my face, and it's really just bad looking when I look close... (Don't get me wrong, you can clearly see them from a distance too, but it's just uglier close-up).

At the moment, I'm using ProActiv. I admit, it cleared away most pimples (even though I still got one or two every now and then), but I really don't see any changes in the marks. FYI, I've been using ProActiv for about a week, so I may have to wait longer, but I have yet to see any ""dramatic"" results they gauranteed.

If anyone could share some sort of products or methods they use to clear away the marks, it would be much appreciated. They're really ugly.","I know exactly what you are talking about. I'm experiencing the same thing too (they DO look bad from distance or angle), and I'm trying to get rid of them as well. Thing is, I think they're just like any scar you would get anywhere on your body. They'll go away eventually. Proactiv, which I've used (I'm just finishing my second, and last set now) contains a chemical that is bleaching to fabric, and I would assume that same chemical is what'll help fade the marks (though they didn't work for me after the first set, and now finishing my second, they're a bit faded, but still there - keep in mind that everyone's skin is different).

So my suggestion would be to look for other products that are meant for Blemish control/Blemish Fighting. However, if you know that you have sensitive skin, don't use anything else in combination Proactiv. It may cause a reaction. And also, for future reference, within the Proactiv line there is a product called 'Advanced Blemish Treatment'. It works very well if used correctly. You know when you know you're about to get a pimple, and the area gets a bit redish and sore-ish...like the warning sign? If you apply a thin layer of it right then, there's a good chance that the pimple will not even develop, and will leave virtually no mark at all. If you have the funds in order, I would suggest you buy it. It's the only Proactiv product I plan to continue to buy. It costs $33 in Canada.... so whereever you're from, do the math. lol.

He ex-rayed my face and there were pockets of stuff in my sinuses.  Everyone I know is complaining of stuffy nose, sinus infection, Katrina cough, sore throats, etc.  You are not doomed. Just get to a doctor and describe what's going on.  Since I took those anti-fungals, I feel much better.  Part of the problem is the mold.  Everything that got wet molded, and with people gutting out their homes, there is all sorts of mold being released into the air.  I wouldn't worry so much about asbestos as the mold.  Also be warned, many of these old houses have layers of lead paint, so lead is also being released.  

This problem will last for quite a while, as a lot of people STILL have not returned to gut their homes.

Another factor for you and others from other areas is the humidity.  If you aren't used to the level of humidity we have here, that could be making you feel even worse.

31,1096916,"If  you had a preemie, how many weeks early?",I had my last daughter 7 weeks early due to my pre-eclampsia and chronic high blood pressure. Also my placenta had aged prematurely and started calcifying. She spent 21 days in special care nursery before I brought her home. She weighed 3 lbs 10 ozs and was 16 inches long. She is doing well. No major health problems. She does have a heart murmur that her pediatrician said will go away as she ages. I have three older boys so she is my princess (not to mention shopping partner)!,"Yes, I had a very premature baby.  10 weeks early.

When I was pregnant with my second after having a healthy, full-term baby the first time, I started to dilate at 24 weeks.

Too late (according to my doc), to stitch my cervix, I had to be in the hospital on bed rest.  My doctor (who was not good) did not explain to me that I may only be 3 cm dilated, but my baby's head was only 6 cm in diameter...so I didn't have to be 10 cm to deliver.  He also did not explain to me that every day missed in the womb takes a weeks to make up outside the womb.  The neonatal intensive care unit staff informed me of these things.

I stayed five weeks in the hospital on bed rest.  My baby girl was born at 29 1/2 weeks gestation.  She weighed 3 lbs 2 ozs and was 15 in long.  She did well, but I vowed I would do anything and everything to make up for the pain she went through struggling just to breathe.

She stayed in the hospital for 6 weeks.  Every day I went to see her and I would have lived at the hospital if I didn't have a 4 year old who needed and missed me very much during the 5 weeks I spent in the hospital pregnant with my second.

She's 10 month's old now, and is catching up.  She is physically and mentally as capable as her peers, meeting every milestone closer and closer to other babies her age.  She now weighs 17 pounds and is 23 inches long.",preemie,,Female,,,,she is my princess,preemie,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If  you had a preemie, how many weeks early?",,"Yes: Yes, I had a very premature baby.",,,

33,1316026,"Mthfr- Thrombophilia- Factor V- homocysteine levels- Heparin- I""M SOOOOOO CONFUSED!?!?!?!?","I had a few miscarriages and finaly 1 doctor suggested testing for thrombophilia. The test showed I have a homozygous Mthfr mutation but the factor V and factor VIII results showed up ""Normal"". I was told to take folic acid every day but I still had another MC afterward so someone suggested I may need Heparin- Someone else told me that if the factor 8 levels were normal I don't need heparin. IM SOOOOOO CONFUSED- Can someone help me make sense of all this??????? (Ps I do have healthy children already, but PLEASE dont tell me to ""be happy with what I have and give up"" we really want another baby).","It seems to me that you should go and consult a REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGIST. Heparin is an anticoagulant (blood thinner); it must be used ONLY UNDER THE ORDERS AND SUPERVISION OF A DOCTOR, because it has a lot of side effects which can be very dangerous and even deadly, specially in a woman who has had several miscarriages AND is trying to conceive. It may actually worsen your condition if used improperly, because it will make you more prone to bleed. You should also avoid using aspirin and its derivatives {like ibuprofen[Motrin, Advil], naproxen[Anaprox, Aleve, Naprosyn] and Coumadin[another kind of anticoagulant similar to heparin]}. First of all, you should treat your underlying condition (thrombophilia= a disease that makes you to have an abnormally low platelet count). Platelets are one of the components in blood, which constitute the body's first line of defense in case of bleeding. Once stabilized, you might try to have another baby, but bear in mind that you are a VERY HIGH RISK patient, and another pregnancy could be harmful, to both you AND the baby-to-be. You should also consult an obstetrician that specializes in high-risk pregnancies for a second opinion and/or further advice or treatment in your case. I wish you the best of luck, and hope that my advice has been of some help and comfort.",Mthfr- Thrombophilia- Factor V- homocysteine levels- Heparin,,Female,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,we really want another baby,Mthfr- Thrombophilia- Factor V- homocysteine levels- Heparin,"I""M SOOOOOO CONFUSED!?!?!?!?",Mthfr- Thrombophilia- Factor V- homocysteine levels- Heparin,,,,,,Can someone help me make sense of all this???????,"PLEASE dont tell me to ""be happy with what I have and give up""",,,,"Yes:  I wish you the best of luck, and hope that my advice has been of some help and comfort.",,,

I just told a friend about your post he said tell her ""dump him and get a new boyfriend"". But of course it is more complicated than that.
In my opinion coming from a female mind you...
He (your boyfriend) most likely hates the fact that he has this condition. He is a man...and a man does not take ""weakness"" well. You can ask, cry, kick and scream but...it's up to him to take care of himself right. Just like people that need AA or in your case people that need Al lanon or therapy.

So the bottom line is ...
you can choose to stay and try to help

you can say i'm leaving because i don't want to see you die.",type 1 diabetic,,Female,,I dont want to see him go through any unnecesary pain and I certainly dont want to lose him before his time.,type 1 diabetic,,,Im really worried about him.,type 1 diabetic,Why wont he take care of himself for me?,type 1 diabetic,,,all he ever does is shoot himself up when he starts to feel bad.,type 1 diabetic,,,He claims that bad things are going to happen to him sooner or later,type 1 diabetic,,,,,,,,Please can someone help me?,,,,,Yes: My grandmother was diabetic,,,

At 21, it was gone, only to reappear in small patches periodically over the years.  Still at times I need a topical med.

35,1446125,"The way this world works, will diabetes ever be cured?","From Wikipedia:
Exubera, inhalable insulin developed by Pfizer, was approved for use in 1-2006. In 4-2006, the UK's NIH advised against the use of inhalable insulin on the grounds that avoiding injections did not justify the higher cost of the new product, estimated at �1100 per year. The NIH recommended in 6-2006 that diabetics should use Exubera only if they could establish 1) a medically proven fear of insulin injections or 2) chronic problems with their insulin injection sites.

Novo Nordisk, filed a lawsuit against Pfizer on 8-2006, claiming patent infringement, seeking both compensatory damages and injunctive relief. Novo sought an injunction preventing the release of Pfizer's 9-2006 launch of Exubera. A federal judge delayed a decision on Novo Nordisk's request for injunctive relief until 12-2006 court hearing. Pfizer's answer contends Novo wants to deny diabetics access to Exubera because it's the only FDA approved inhalable insulin & would hurt Novo Nordisk's business.","When was the last time any big moneymaking disease was cured?

(8)Autistic Kids.
1. Autistic Kids Disorder 
Autistic Kids symptoms:

(A) total of six (or more) items from (1), (2), and (3), 
with at least two from (1),
and one each from (2) and (3): 


1. Autism Autistic Kids qualitative impairment in social interaction, as manifested by at least two of the following: 
(a) Impairment in the use of multiple non-verbal behaviors such as eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression, body postures, and gestures to regulate social interaction 
(b) failure to developed relationships appropriate to developmental level 
(c) a lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or achievements with other people (e.g., by a lack of showing, bringing, or pointing out objects of interest) 
(d) lack of social or emotional response


2. Autism qualitative impairments in communication as manifested by at least one of the following: 
(a) delay in, or total lack of, the development of spoken language (not accompanied by an attempt to compensate through alternative modes of communication such as gestures or mime) 
(b) without adequate speech, marked impairment by in the ability to initiate or sustain a conversation with others 
(c) repetitive use of language or words or phases
(d) lack of varied, spontaneous make-believe play or social imitative play appropriate to developmental level 


3. Autism restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities, as manifested by at least one of the following: 
(a) autism encompassing preoccupation with one or more stereotyped patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus 
(b) autism apparently inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional routines or rituals 
(c) stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms (e.g., hand or finger flapping or twisting, or complex whole-body movements or with an object) 
(d) autism persistent of liking an object, movements with sound.


(B) Delays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas,
with onset around 2 and half of age to 3 and half years old:
(1) social interaction, 
(2) language as used in social communication, or 
(3) symbolic or imaginative play (playing or talking some form of outer space words or cartoon's words or play). 


Symptoms of Asperser's include: impaired ability to utilize social cues such as body language, irony, or other subtext of communication; restricted eye contact and socialization; limited range of encyclopedic interests; preservative, odd behaviors; didactic, verbose, monotone, droning voice; concrete thinking; over-sensitivity to certain stimuli; and unusual movements. 

All these are the symptom of autism and we have the treatment for all these problem. You have to spend enough time for the intensive treatment in order to get good result, it varies from 1 month to 6 months or more for intensive treatment (remedies, remedy).
Some of the Autistic kids that is difficult to get near to 100 % cure is that they started late on themselves more then 11 years old for some, and others are too stubborn, but we still gets major improvement about 80-90% or so until they can get easy living in their life.
We have long distance friends that",I think that this like many other things that have come and gone in the past years is unfortunatly not a cure.  People are always claiming that a diet or something is going to cure autism.  I work with children with autism and I've never heard about this working.  I know 5 years ago when they thought vaccines may be causing autism it was all over the news.  I think if it did it would be on the news and all over the place - because a cure for autism would be a big deal.  This may be a good treatment for some children but I don't think cure is the right word.

If you are having fevers and back pain, the infection may have gotten to your kidneys, and this could be very serious. I suggest you go to the doctor as soon as possible, or to the emergency room if you can't go to a doctor. You may need some strong antibiotics and IV fluids to cure this.

15,2399819,Mom & Dad's Rules vs. Nana's?,"My kids spent the weekend at my in-laws' house.  YAY!!  Wait, that's not the question. :-)

When my husband picked them up on Sunday they were eating dinner.  One of our sons didn't have much of an appetite and asked to be excused before he finished.  My husband told him to take two more bites, then he could go.  Our meal-time rule is to try everything on the plate, but you don't have to ""clean"" the plate (studies show forcing kids to eat can lead to eating disorders and obesity).  My mother-in-law launched into a lecture about wasting food and how hard Grandpa works, blah blah blah.  She told my husband the kids would have to ""learn the rules at Nana's house"" ~ basically saying (in front of our son) there's something wrong with our rules.  Now, I don't mind if they bend rules regarding TV time and bedtime at Nana's, and they are actually a little more strict than we are on some things, but this is different to me.  Any thoughts?","Your rules supercede theirs. Its your kids. Like you said, some things you'll let them fudge on. But tell her what rules must be followed and why. Grandparents like to do whatever they want, but its not in the child's best interests. And you're right, forcing a kid to eat all of something they hate doesn't do any good. They had their turn to parent. Its your turn now. Tell them you respect them and their house, but some of your rules are too important in the way you both want to raise your children. Then tell them what is ok and not ok to change.

24,603359,Hi im 18 and for the past few days iv had stools with streaks of blood on the surface. Can i have hemmorhoids?,"The reason why I ask is bcause i know that blood on the stool is a serious symptom and can mean colon cancer, but i think i heard that tis uncommon for my age....Anyway, the stools look normal usually and normal in color, just that in some places there have been small streaks of blood on the surface.. Thjis really made me panicc but i also thought of the possibility of a hemmorhoid, since after i wiped, i was very itchy and when i wiped again fresh blood was on the paper which made me think that the blood was added to the stool on the way out due to a hemmorhoid i might not know about..Anyways i reallly just wnated to see some opinions, and try to ease my mind...thanks","Hi Nic

I seriously doubt you have cancer, but be sure to do a colon cleanse. You must remove the toxins in the body and if you dont have regular healthy bowel movements, that is what causes illness and disease because the toxins get into the blood stream. 

Educate yourself on cleansing and drink at least a gallon of distilled water a day. Be sure to also get more nutriton especially raw vegetables.

Best of health to you

31,1661446,Could heart disease be causing the intense discomfort in my throat in the morning?,"I was a pack-and-1/2 a day smoker for a decade.  I quit in Aug. '05.  I'm 31yo, I've been doing cardio exercise for months now.  I noticed circulation probs that have become less severe since I quit smoking, but my arms still go to sleep easily while in bed. I also feel short of breath sometimes, when laying down & on the treadmill. The worst symptom is an intense ""pain"" or empty feeling (somewhat hard to describe) emanating from my throat in the early mornings after I urinate, it keeps me from going back to sleep. I think ""angina"" describes this pain, but it's in the throat--not the chest. I used to think this was a withdrawl symptom from nicotine. I used to get it back when I was a smoker; it would go away with my 1st morning cigarette. But as I weened myself off nicotine, first with nicorette gum, then cold turkey since Dec '05, the pains have gotten worse and sometimes persist into early afternoon, not every day but at least several days/week.  I also rarely get satisfying sleep.","It does sound a lot like acid reflux.  You may be supplementing your nicotine urges with food (especially before bed) or just the stress of resisting your urges may be causing some increased acid production.  

Angina is not typically after sleeping or urinating, unless it is ""unstable angina"" which is unpredictable (but not consistently at the same time).  Throat pain can be angina, but usually is accompanied by sweating and shortness of breath and will sometimes radiate down to the chest with a crushing feeling.

As far as the acid reflux part of the equation (not likely Barrett's Esophagus, which is a change in the skin lining the esophagus), you should try taking an acid reducing medication once per day an hour before dinner.  You should also not eat any food at least 2-3 hours before bed, and if possible, you might want to put a phone book under each foot at the head of the bead.  

A couple of medications you can try (over the counter) are Prilosec, Pepcid or Zantac.  Avoid medications like Tums, Pepto, etc, which are short-acting and do not treat the underlying problem.  If your symptoms don't resolve after a week, you will need to have this problem looked at.

You are at significant cardiac risk (because of your other symptoms and history), so you should be getting regular check-ups (twice yearly minimum).  If you experience chest pain on the treadmill, you need to be seen IMMEDIATELY.  I am happy to hear you are exercising, and you should keep it up every day.",heart disease,,,,,,,,"The worst symptom is an intense ""pain"" or empty feeling (somewhat hard to describe) emanating from my throat in the early mornings",t keeps me from going back to sleep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Yes: You are at significant cardiac risk (because of your other symptoms and history), so you should be getting regular check-ups (twice yearly minimum).

Go for a one-time treatment called Atlasprofilax. One of the effects is, that the pressure on the discs is distributed much better - so the bulging disc may recover completely.

36,3080691,Bully at school?,"My son is being bullied at school and there is nothing I hate more than bullies. I was bullied severly starting in 5th grade to the point to where I just didnt want to go on anymore. I would have never killed myself, but that is how I felt. It was horrible to be tortured everyday, and to make matters worse I was very shy and I was afraid to tell my mom, so the bullying just got worse until I broke down at home one day and my mom finally went to the school to put a stop to it. NOW my son is going through this and he is in the 3rd grade. I just cant even stand this. I have gone to the teachers and they say that he is fine and no one messes with him. Well teachers dont always see everything that goes on. Same thing in my case. The teachers never always saw what was going on. He has Aspergers Syndrome which is a high functioning autism, so Im sure he is an easier target for them. What advice can I give him. I just dont know what to say to him exactly.","If you went to the teachers and nothing was done, you need to go straight to the principal.  A lot of teachers may resent the idea that they have to ""raise"" children, because it's their job only to educate, so they may be ignoring problems, or training themselves to overlook them because it's easier.  Your son deserves to get an education within a safe environment.  Adults would get ""charged"" with creating a hostile work environment, so it should be no different.  If nothing changes, go to the school board.  Raise heck!! And don't stop until it changes.

Bullies *are* insecure with themselves, but sometimes it's hard to stand up for yourself when you feel cornered by everyone.  I was always told to ignore it, but it never stopped them from following me down the hall until the bell rang.  The only thing that would help is for your son to be confident and assertive with his replies, which is hard when you're shy and in that situation to begin with.  But at some point, he's got to learn to stand up for himself, or else it will last through high school.",Bully at school,,Female,,My son is being bullied at school and there is nothing I hate more than bullies.,bullied,,,,,,,,,,,,,"He has Aspergers Syndrome which is a high functioning autism, so Im sure he is an easier target for them",easier target,,,,,,,,I just dont know what to say to him exactly.,,,What advice can I give him.,,Yes: Your son deserves to get an education within a safe environment.  ,,,
