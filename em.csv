3,2552587,Swollen lump w/pain to touch and strange discomfort in lower abdomen/pelvic region.?,"I had not noticed anything at all and have become slightly bothered now without any information as to -what- it could be. Help?
The lump is slightly larger than 1 inch long, in an oval shape about 3/4-1inch thick.  I would guess the volume of about 1cubic inch total. It's hard, not squishy, and doesn't move more than a hair in any direction. It seems to be fine until I touch it. It's not like 'ouch!' painful, just tender. The skin around it is smooth and red, stretched a bit.  It's located dead-center between my belly button and gential area. Doesn't seem to be a lymphnode but I am not that familiar with lymphnodes.  When I gently pressed around it I noticed also that above my genital region the whole area (size of palm) is puffy. My lower gut and the general problem area has kind of had this faint ache sensation move through it quickly and then go away. I am not otherwise having problems. Any idea what this is, or could be? I really can't afford to see a doctor.","Lymph nodes are located off to the sides, not dead center in the abdomen.  I'm betting on a hernia.  Please read more about it here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia

Because you are female, this could certainly be something more profound and I agree with the others... you can't afford NOT to go to the doctor.  

Call your local Health Department, explain your situation, ask if there is a free or low cost way to be seen in your city/county.  If you experience intense pain, discomfort, fever or additional swelling, go to the Emergency Room and tell them that you have no insurance, but would like to speak with a social worker to see if you qualify for assistance or bill reduction.

Keep in mind that while it might cost a bit at this point, it will probably only get worse later, risk your health to a large degree and certainly won't get less expensive to treat... only more complex.

I will tell you that this does NOT sound like anything I can think of that would go away on its own.  Even fibroids would probably move a bit when you touch the area.  Hernias can be quite dangerous if they go untreated, so please make arrangements to be seen by a qualified physician.

He is always short of breath and caughs  alot and when i talk to him he sometimes forgets what we are talking about. Is there any way to get him to stop drinking and smoking. or is it to late. If we were just to cut him off from these things should we do it gradually or just at one time.,"First of all, as heartbreaking his self destructive behaviour is, your grandpa is an adult, and able to do what he wants. if he doesn't want to give up the booze and ciggies, then he won't no matter what you attempt. Given his symptoms, it is late for him to change, I am sure he has been smoking for decades by now. However, you can always speak to him and say. ""Gramps, i really love you, and would like to have you around longer in my life. If you want to give up smoking and drinking, I will help you. But it breaks my heart to see you like this.""
Don't cut him cold turkey, both alcohol and cigarettes are addictive, and you are just asking him to sneak around behind your back to indulge his habits. If he is drinking a bottle of vodka a day, he is definitely an alcoholic, and cutting him off would result in serious withdrawal symptoms.

7,2286054,Why do doctors hand out statins like they are candy to people who don't even have very high cholesterol levels,"One doctor prescribed 4 different statins to my husband over a period of a few years.  Each one caused serious chest pains!

Then I had some cholesterol levels that got high after going on Atkins.

Guess what? I figured it out and within 2 days of stopping Zetia, everything was almost back to normal!
Don't tell me that this side-effect is ""rare""!  It's probably present to some extent in a large fraction of the population.

If you continue to have such low numbers, and your doctor doesn't do anything, get another opinion.  Your blood sugar level should never go that low.  Also make sure that your glucometer is properly calibrated.

As far as snacks go, the best thing to do IS to have small snacks between your meals and before bed.  That keeps your metabolism going.  Try a couple pretzels and a piece of cheese, or some apple and peanut butter.  Always make sure that you eat protein when you eat carbs.

What is diarrhea?

Diarrhea�loose, watery stools occurring more than three times in one day�is a common problem that usually lasts a day or two and goes away on its own without any special treatment. However, prolonged diarrhea can be a sign of other problems. People with diarrhea may pass more than a quart of stool a day.

Diarrhea can cause dehydration, which means the body lacks enough fluid to function properly. Dehydration is particularly dangerous in children and the elderly, and it must be treated promptly to avoid serious health problems. 

People of all ages can get diarrhea. The average adult has a bout of diarrhea about four times a year.

What causes diarrhea?

Diarrhea may be caused by a temporary problem, like an infection, or a chronic problem, like an intestinal disease. A few of the more common causes of diarrhea are

Bacterial infections. Several types of bacteria, consumed through contaminated food or water, can cause diarrhea. Common culprits include Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, and Escherichia coli. Food poisoning, intestinal fluare known causes.  


Viral infections. Many viruses cause diarrhea, including rotavirus, Norwalk virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and viral hepatitis.


Food intolerances. Some people are unable to digest some component of food, such as lactose, the sugar found in milk.


Parasites. Parasites can enter the body through food or water and settle in the digestive system. Parasites that cause diarrhea include Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica, and Cryptosporidium.


Reaction to medicines, such as antibiotics, blood pressure medications, and antacids containing magnesium.


Intestinal diseases, like inflammatory bowel disease or celiac disease., or Crohn's Disease, 
Whipple Disease; ulcerative colitis,.


Functional bowel disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome, in which the intestines do not work normally. Alcohol and laxative abuse are classified in here.   I'm diagnosed with this.  I'm taking Tagamet for it. No more cramps and diarrhea. 

How Is Diarrhea Treated?

If you have a mild case of diarrhea, you can just let it run its course, or you can treat it with an over-the-counter medicine.Common brand names include Pepto-Bismol, Imodium A-D and Kaopectate, which are available as liquids or tablets. Follow the instructions on the package. 

In addition, you should drink at least six 8-ounce glasses of fluid per day. Choose fruit juice without pulp, broth or soda (without caffeine). Chicken broth (without the fat), tea with honey and sports drinks are also good choices. Instead of drinking liquids with your meals, drink liquids between meals. Drink small amounts of fluids frequently. 

How Can I Relieve Discomfort in the Rectal Area



Some people develop diarrhea after stomach surgery or removal of the gallbladder. The reason may be a change in how quickly food moves through the digestive system after stomach surgery or an increase in bile in the colon that can occur after gallbladder surgery.

In most cases, replacing lost fluid to prevent dehydration is the only treatment necessary. Medicines that stop diarrhea may be helpful in some cases, but they are not recommended for people whose diarrhea is caused by a bacterial infection or parasite�stopping the diarrhea traps the organism in the intestines, prolonging the problem. Instead, doctors usually prescribe antibiotics. Viral causes are either treated with medication or left to run their course, depending on the severity and type of the virus

31,2050609,Cervical cancer treatment...?,"Ok, here's my story, I had an abnormal pap done a few years ago, ignored it and didnt have another one done until i found out i was pregnant, it came back abnormal once again but i couldn't do anything about it until after i had the baby (for obvious reasons). Now, after i had my son i had to get a biopsy done and i have two areas of abnormal cell growth and if they are left they will eventually turn into cancer. So i now have to go and get a procedure called LEEP done, where they cut the affected areas out. Has anyone ever had this done? If so does it hurt alot? What about afterwards? Need some words of encouragement  please! Thanks",I have had this done.When you go in they will show you a movie about Dysphlasia { not sure if I spelled it rite but you know what i mean}and how they remove it. What will happen if they do not get it all or it comes back.I know that you are scared.I was terrified.But remeber they caught it early which means chances are they will get it all the first time. As for the Leep it's self honestly it's not fun.But they do freeze the effected area before they do it.What I found more uncomfortable was having the freezing needles put in.I had some  cramping after that lasted about 3 days.I just took Motrin for it. I had to go back every 6 month for 2 years to have Biopsies taken just to be sure it did not come back. I now make sure that I never miss my pap.Good Luck if you need to talk feel free to e-mail me.

please i dont want to hear the you shouldn't get them, be happy with yourself, and the bla, blah, blah, blah.  i know i've  heard it b4.  i'm just asking a question okay.  thanks for the ppl that will actually answer my question and not lecture me.  thanks.","Breast Implants  surgery is very safe nowadays. My cousin got her breast reduction, tummy tuck and facelift surgery in India by the company called Forerunners Healthcare .The Price for the surgery she paid in India was very less. She paid 30% of the cost she was quoted in America.

Forerunners Healthcare is very famous in India. They arrange cosmetic and plastic surgery for foreigners in India. I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and about their patient stories. They arrange financing for USA, Canadian, UK and other international patients who plan to have surgery abroad for low price, as the breast reduction, tummy tuck, facelift and other cosmetic surgery is not covered by insurance. They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. There are huge cost savings. As a doctor I personally believe that surgery can be easily handled in India, as the quality of healthcare available In India is simply best in the world. The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star.

You absolutely MUST speak with your boyfriend and his doctor ASAP about what's going on.

There are many, many types of brain cancers (as well as benign tumors, though you said this is a ""stage 3"" tumor, so I will assume it's cancer).  Not all of them result in the stereotypical cancer ""constitutional"" symptoms of weight loss, nausea, fever, etc.

Different cancers, of course, have different survivabilities.  ""Stage 3"" does not always mean imminent death; in fact (using an example), a majority of people with certain blood lymphomas can be cured at stage 3.  

I do not know much about brain cancers, so please do get more details on the specific kind of tumor your boyfriend has.

Please help what should i do? I'm desperate. We have been seeing gynae for advice and checks up too. We spent much for that too. Do you think this endo caused infertile me? Help...!!","I have endometriosis and fibroids. I lost four babies, two with ectopic pregnancy, one chemical preg and one blighted ovum. The month I was scheduled to have an hystersalpingogram (hsg) test, I got pregnant and now I am in my second trimester with a healthy baby in-utero.

I would suggest you ask your doctor about an hsg test. Basically the procedure involves shooting dye up your cervix, uterus and fallopian tubes. They then take an xray to check for blockages. Blockages are a major contributing factor for infertility in endo patients. The great thing about this test is that often times, the act of shooting the dye up into the fallopian tubes will clear them out enough to allow the sperm to enter and fertilize an egg and then allow the egg passage back to the uterus.

My husband and I decided to try one last time before the test and we used pre-seed which is a sperm friendly lubricant. It was the first and only time we had ever used this product-and low and behold two weeks later I had a positive hpt. If you are interested, just google ""preseed"" and you should find it. It isn't expensive and I have heard other great stories about the stuff.

There are no blood tests, brain scans, or psychological tests that definitively diagnose it.  There are many combinations of cognitive and behavioral problems that may exist.  ).  Symptoms of this syndrome may include: Poor impulse control and internal self-monitoring, attention inconsistencies, chronic procrastination, the need for instant gratification, poor organizational skills, hyperactivity and hypoactivity, poor peer relationships, poor concept of time, and the need for highly stimulating activities.

Failure to treat ADHD carries significant risks whose lifelong consequences are well known: Failure to get an
education, poor self?esteem, substance abuse, and antisocial behaviors that become habitual and can contribute to failure at life.

ADD/ADHD is not an imaginary disorder.  It is a chronic developmental disorder which is genetically based.  It is not a learning disability, but can co?exist with learning disabilities in approximately 25 to 33 percent of those diagnosed with ADD/ADHD.

There are studies that have found that stimulants are the single most effective way to treat this disorder.  Unfortunately, there is no type of medication that will cure ADD/ADHD.

Heartburn can cause pain like angina at times,BUT so can an anxiety or panic attack. I personally have experienced anxiety attacks,and my last one,in particular I swore i was having a heart attack. You may need to go to the doctor or emergency room for an accurate diagnosis and treatment. 

Obviously there is something going on with you right now,but try to relax and calm down. Tell yourself that you will be ok. If you can't drive yourself,call someone to take you in to the ER.

It could also be that your gallbladder is inflamed and causing the pain.

It could also be anxiety caused from being stressed out and when you stress sometimes you can hyperventilate and that can cause unexplained heart/chest pains.

5,3760952,Heart attack; what are my chances of dieing of a heart attack when i grow up?,"im 16, my father past away feb. 23rd 2006 of a amssive heart attack and my grandma died of a massive heart attack, both on my dad's side...is there any chance i will also have a bad heart when i grow up? i already have medical problems...i have a sleep apnea, a spinal cord problem and many alergies to different things, but most of those don't matter, im just very afraid of having a bad heart....could someone help me possibly?","Dear Bobo:

I think it is very natural to feel worried about a heart attack if one's father has just died of one a couple of months ago. 

Here is my answer:

FIRST: You ARE worried; the question is, SHOULD you be worried? 

The answer is more difficult than just statistics. If you want statistics, cardiac risk, i.e. the risk of a heart attack can be easily calculated:

http://hp2010.nhlbihin.net/atpiii/calculator.asp

But as it states, this calculator, which is used nearly universally by physicians, applies only for those age 20 or greater. Why is that? Because the heart is like pump -- like any mechanical thing, be it one's car or one's sneakers, it wears out over time, and the older one is, the more likely one is have one's heart give out. Since 20 year olds rarely die of heart attacks (i.e. unless you do crack, etc), its not possible to calculate the odds for the ""average"" 16 year old.

SECOND: What IS a heart attack? Generally, it implies a blockage of one of the arteries supplying blood to the heart. The heart, like any muscle, or any machine, requires fuel -- in this case, oxygen, which is supplied to it by the piping called coronary arteries. When these get plugged up, like any pipe, what is needed can't get through. When this happens to living tissue, the tissue dies. In the case of the heart, as it is the main (and only) pump supplying blood to the rest of the body, if the damage is servere enough, then the pump (i.e. heart) completely fails, the entire body is starved of oxygen, and one passes away.

What, then, makes one more likely to have a heart attack? Many things, such as genetics, i.e. a family history of heart disease. But, from this discription, anything that stresses or clogs the piping (arteries) to the heart -- i.e. causes heart disease, also known as atherosclerosis. Stuff like high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes (sugar in the piping, like sugar-water on the table, is sticky and gums up the works), high cholesterol, obesity (which is often a cause of SLEEP APNEA), all increase one's risk.

Generally, when a healthy 16 year old walks into a doctor's office asking, am i at risk for a heart attack, the physician will likely wonder why the patient is asking, rather than being worried about the patient actually being at risk.

Which brings me to YOUR question: ""could somebody help me?"" 

-- the answer I think is: please, please consider talking to a counselor at your school; friends, siblings, a hotline, a doctor. You are worried about your mortality; And right after a family member has died, more so. It's natural, but often, it helps to talk about it. 

Go ask your doctor this question, and see what she or he has to say. It'll be worth it. As for heart disease, see your doctor regularly over the years, listen to their advice, and . . .

Keep well, keep healthy.

The majority of these cases are not associated with any other condition (isolated findings). However, some syndromes include pectus excavatum.

A Dynamic Chest Compressor (DCC) brace by itself is useless unless it is worn for the correct daily number of hours according to each period of the treatment and applied along with an appropriate program of exercises. Specialized medical supervision with photographic documentation, periodic adjustments in the brace and solution of eventual complications are essential for a successful treatment.

For example, my goal several years ago was to graduate from college.  I started out and I really found myself struggling and sinking rather than being able to stay afloat.  I failed a class in college after being an A student in high school.  I realized that setting a goal as abstract as ""graduate from college"" was not going to help me.  I needed to focus on the here and now.  So I had a goal of graduating from college, but I set a more specific objective that for the current semester I would get straight A's no matter how much work it took.  I focused on this objective each semester and I actually managed to succeed in obtaining straight As in all of my classes and graduated college as the valedictorian commencement speaker for a graduating class of thousands of students.  Clearly I had not only met my goal ,but exceeded what I ever could have imagined doing.  Like you, I had mental health issues, and while I didn't get into any legal troubles, I never sought out the help I needed which would have eased my load a lot over the years.

My advice to you would be narrow your focus on the here and now.  It's great to have long-term aspirations, but what are you going to do right now to help you get there... you need to plan out where you want your life to be in one day, one month, one year, etc.  No one wakes up one morning and magically has all of their hopes and dreams come true.  Through hard work and many, many failures you begin to make progress toward your dreams.  It's not easy and when you combine a mental illness with attaining your dreams, it makes it that much more difficult.  Not impossible by any means.  You need to start by sitting down and thinking not about what your dreams are (because clearly you already know), but rather figure out what you need to do to get there.  Suddenly you will feel that your life has direction and purpose and YOU WILL SUCCEED.  

I also want to applaud you for getting the help you need for your psychological issue.  You have more strength to do that than many people, including myself.

EDIT:
I realize how much of a YA! addict I am when I went to my doctor's appt. Friday and asked about your situation and the answer that my doc gave was under no circumstance that a doctor should say anything about a patient gaining weight if they have an eating disorder because this is a battle that they will continue fight as long as they live even if they seem to getting better.
She also stated the weight is really not a big deal and if the doctor was concern about her weight then it he should have ask how is eating habits now? how often does she exercises? things of that nature and decide if he should bring up that continue to make the progress or say for a healthier heart and body you need to cut down on sweets and carbs and exercise more and also never pull out the weight and height chart for a person that has a disorder because in the patient's like you pulling out a magazine in to them and showing a very skinny model and say this is how you suppose to look, this is what the patient hear remember the patient has a distorted view of her weight image.

35,2092774,Does anyone have experiece/know of treatment options for chiari?,"Hello, I was wondering if anyone has had experience with chiari and knew of any treatments. My boyfriend (he is 20) has just been diagnosed with the disease (has off-and-on, mild to severe headaches) and friends and family are trying to find out as much as possible. 

He has seen a neurosurgeon, but he said the only option was surgery, with a bovine skull replacement, or just deal w/ the headaches (unless neurological signs begin). It seemed like a pretty hollistic view. His mom has already found out the bovine skull is not necessary for the surgury.

He is going in for a second opinion in LA and have a MRI of the spine as well. I was just wondering if anyone else had experience with this and knew of other ways to treat it? Some of the info is vague, I'm not sure if it is type 1 or 2, and the cyst is about 4 cm large right now :/ Thanks so much in advance, and any help is greatly appreciated!","Treatment Options for Chiari Malformation
Neurologists and neurosurgeons at Mayo Clinic take a conservative approach to treating Chiari malformation to spare patients unnecessary surgery that will not alleviate their symptoms. While many people may have a subtle Chiari malformation that is evident on an MRI, few malformations are serious enough to warrant treatment.

The goal of treatment is to halt or reverse the progression of signs and symptoms. This may be accomplished by surgery to relieve the pressure on the brain stem, cerebellum and spinal cord, and to re-establish spinal fluid circulation.

The surgical procedure (posterior fossa craniectomy or posterior fossa decompression), involves removing a small section of bone at the back of the head to relieve pressure by making more room for the cerebellum. The covering of the brain (dura) may also be enlarged with a patch created from synthetic material or tissue from the patient's leg muscle. This helps make more room for the brain and the spinal cord and helps to establish the flow of cerebral spinal fluid. The operation generally takes two to three hours. Recovery time in the hospital could take from two to four days.

A cervical laminectomy is also performed. This involves the removal of the bone forming the back of the vertebra or lamina. Both the posterior fossa decompression and the cervical laminectomy are done at the same time, through the same surgical incision in the back of the head and upper neck.

Occasionally, the surgery may be modified if there is a syrinx (fluid-filled cavity in the spinal cord) present or if the patient has hydrocephalus. Most patients who have the surgery do quite well and their symptoms improve.

Surgery performed on patients who can truly benefit from the operation often successfully relieves the symptoms of Chiari malformation.",treatment options for chiari,,Female,,,,,," My boyfriend (he is 20) has just been diagnosed with the disease (has off-and-on, mild to severe headaches) and friends and family are trying to find out as much as possible.

36,2595940,carboplatin only for ovarian cancer?,"My mom's dr gave her taxol and carboplatin for her first treatment, but for the second he just did carboplatin saying that many european studies say the results are the same if  carboplatin is used alone and not with taxol.  Just wondering if anyone has heard this or if this is the right course to go.  Not too many options though as my mom is without insurance and can't get any financial assistance.","I have copied the following text from the NCI website. This info applies the Stage 3 and 4 ovarian cancer. This is essentially the ""bible"" when it comes to treating cancer. Carbo has been given alone as first line therapy and showed essentially the same overall and progression free survival as carbo/Taxol with less side effects.

Systemic chemotherapy

Since cisplatin was approved in 1979, first-line treatment of ovarian cancer has consisted of this drug being given intravenously or its second-generation analog, carboplatin, being given either alone or in combination with other drugs. Clinical response rates from these drugs regularly exceed 60%, and median time-to-recurrence usually exceeds 1 year in this subset of suboptimally debulked women. Trials by various cooperative groups in the subsequent two decades addressed issues of optimal dose-intensity [15-17] for both cisplatin and carboplatin,[18] schedule, [19] and the equivalent results obtained with either of these platinum drugs, usually in combination with cyclophosphamide.[20] With the introduction of the taxane paclitaxel in the early 1990s, two trials confirmed the superiority of cisplatin combined with paclitaxel to the previous standard of cisplatin plus cyclophosphamide; however, two trials that compared the agent with either cisplatin or carboplatin as a single agent failed to confirm such superiority in all outcome parameters (i.e., response, time-to-progression, and survival) 
Nevertheless, for patients with ovarian cancer, the combination of cisplatin or carboplatin and paclitaxel has been used as the initial treatment (defined as induction chemotherapy) for a number of reasons:

GOG-132 was regarded by many as showing that sequential treatment of cisplatin and paclitaxel was equivalent to the combination because many patients crossed over before progression; moreover, the cisplatin only arm was more toxic because it utilized a 100 mg/m2 dose.[21] 
The Medical Research Council (MRC)-ICON3 study, while having fewer early crossovers, could be interpreted similarly in regard to the impact on survival of sequential treatment.[22] 
Data from MRC-ICON4 have shown a survival advantage for patients treated with the combination treatment regimen versus those treated with single-agent carboplatin upon recurrence (see Table 2). 
In past trials, single-agent platinums were not superior to platinum combined with an alkylating agent; therefore, the explanation of a detrimental effect of cyclophosphamide is unlikely. 
Since the adoption of the platinum-plus-taxane combination as the standard nearly worldwide, clinical trials have demonstrated:

noninferiority for carboplatin plus paclitaxel versus cisplatin plus paclitaxel,[23-25] 
noninferiority for carboplatin plus paclitaxel versus carboplatin plus docetaxel,[26] and
no advantage, but increased toxic effects, by adding epirubicin to the carboplatin plus paclitaxel doublet.[27] 
A study started by the GOG with international collaboration, currently published in abstract form, compared the carboplatin-plus-paclitaxel standard to two carboplatin-containing sequential doublets (one with topotecan and one with gemcitabine) followed by carboplatin plus paclitaxel, and to two triplets including either pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or gemcitabine with the standard doublet. No differences have emerged.[28]

ANd here are some ideas....not sure what you have tried.
Most people swallow this material without ever noticing it, while it is still tiny. In those whose tonsils are large, however, the particles can lodge in the deep crypts, where they continue to grow. The enlarging lumps are called calculi of the tonsil, or tonsilloliths (tonsil stones). These stones are most common during adolescence.

Microscopic studies of these tonsilloliths have shown them to contain a combination of food particles, bacteria, oral debris, and white blood cells in a concentrically laminated pattern -- rather like a pearl. Usually they are small gritty particles found in the center of soft, cheesy flecks. Sometimes, however, they become quite large, appearing as rough, yellow or gray, round stones. At times they reach an extraordinary size. Affected people usually have a history of repeated attacks of tonsillitis in earlier years.

Most people with calculi of the tonsils have no associated symptoms. In that case nothing need be done, except perhaps for brushing or scraping them out, as your daughter does. Gargling, refraining from eating during the 30 minutes before falling asleep, and careful oral hygiene may help minimize their formation.

For some people, however, the calculi can be quite bothersome, causing a constant foreign-body sensation, a chronic low-grade sore throat, recurrent episodes of tonsillitis persisting beyond childhood, or chronic bad breath.

Treatment consists of either removing the tonsils or removing the calculi. Troublesome large calculi that are not easily dislodged may need an ear, nose, and throat doctor to remove them.  http://www.drgreene.com/21_568.html
Tonsil Stones don't do any physical harm, and sporadically coughing them up doesn't mean that there is anything wrong. However, they can be annoying and sometimes they are an indication that you have bad breath. Normally, Normally one does not do much for them, except gargle with hydrogen peroxide. A simple combination of drugs and nasal drops can effectively eliminate tonsil stones without unnecessary tonsil surgery. Plus, occasional use of a nasal spray helps neutralise the anaerobic sulfur-producing bacteria on contact.   http://www.doctorndtv.com/topicsh/Tonsil%20stones.asp
The only sure-fire method for ridding yourself of this problem is to have your tonsils removed (tonsillectomy), but there are nonsurgical alternatives which you should certainly pursue before you ask an ENT to take out your tonsils:
 You could try gargling frequently with warm salt water (1 teaspoon of table salt mixed with one pint of water gargle with about 1/4 cup of this mixture three times per day, after meals.)
 You could also gargle with a mouthwash called Alkalol, which is essentially salt water combined with a variety of natural aromatic extracts; some people prefer Alkalol to plain salt water. Most other commercial mouthwashes contain sugar or alcohol, which are pleasant-tasting but are, in the long run, fairly irritating if used frequently.
 There is a doctor in Los Angeles, Murray Grossan, who markets a water-jet device for ""hosing down"" the tonsils. Relative to gargling, this device provides a more aggressive technique for clearing out those nasty crypts.
 In the hopes of avoiding tonsillectomy, I will often put my patient on a long (3 to 4 week) course of antibiotics in the hope that this will allow the tonsils to ""settle down"" (become less inflamed.) I must admit that antibiotics are not a very effective cure for this problem.  http://www.doctorhoffman.com/xlith.htm

47,1609429,What's the next step?,"I've been struggling with a medical problem since December 2004, shortly after I had food poisoning from undercooked chicken, but most doctors I've seen said these are allergies with an unknown cause.

I've seen mostly eye, ENT and allergy doctors and I've taken a number of anti-allergy things, but the only things which have been effective in improvement have been Augmentin (875MG) and TobraDex.  I've moved to a different apartment, changed clothes and furniture, changed shampoo and soaps... everything I can think of.  What's the next step for me?","Boy that sounds miserable!

Okay, you've said that augmentin helped you. When I ran a quick search, I found it was related to penicillin. So that means that you're probably still dealing with some very stubborn infections.

Try drinking cranberry juice. At the very least, it shouldn't hurt (unless you're allergic). And it has been shown to be effective against a number of harmful bacteria. Try eating and drinking to boost your immune system. That might also help your energy problem- and as uncomfortable as you are, I would be surprised if you were resting. So the fatigue doesn't surprise me at all. Also, if you are drinking a lot of soda, stop. Drink teas instead. Those are quite tasty, and also have stuff that is good for you.

I know this isn't much. But hopefully it's enough to give you a start.

There was a hard boney lump at the injury and it swelled for a few days but I ignored it up until now. The swelling went away, but the boney bump never did, neither did the pain. This past weekend, I fell and re-injured the same spot, again causing it to swell. The swelling has gone away again, but the pain is terrible!! I can barely walk.

'need an answer' you state you are a medical professional. All I can say is thank god I dont have anything to do with you. What a closed mind. As someone also in the medical profession, what you allude to certainly does happen however you are being extremely judgemental here, and remember it's the internet here. sounds like you are purely siding with the doctor.... people usually do that to protect their own.

I prefer to have an open mind and treat each patient as an individual, have in my mind the potential reasons why patients have complications... but assess each case on it's own merits.

'treefrog' - nice answer. Hope you are going well.

To help the person asking this question however ----

Sepsis and septic infection literally means an infection around the site.. which has the potential to travel around the body and cause many more serious problems. It is not uncommon to have infections after a surgery. The professionals involved do everything they can to reduce the risk however  they cannot reduce the risk to zero. We all have bugs that live on our skin happily, healthily fighting off other viruses and bugs that we come into contact with. It's when these bugs get into your system, into a spot they shouldnt that they cause trouble. The treatment you have undegone is fairly standard for your condition and complication ( in regards to the antibiotics) It is vitally important that the infection get under control so that your knee surgery can finally be finished.

However if you had told me this story... I would have the following concerns - 

1. Sounds like the doctor, by what you describe here, isnt listening to you, or is... but not allaying your fears. that is all about communication. If potentially he isnt hearing what you are saying, or not explaining things properly because you may be too upset to listen properly, my suggestion is to take a friend along to your next appointment. Have a list of questions written down and ask them, one by one. Do not give your doctor the list, just ask them the way you have written them - its your list, you need to understand it.

2. The doctor removing medication from your handbag. I am afraid no professional has the right to do this. The medication is legally prescribed, you have had it legally dispensed from a pharmacist, it has your name on it. It is yours. My question here to him would be... why did you do that... why havent you sent them to me... If he thinks you may be starting to have an addiction to pain medication... then he has handled it poorly. Communication is the key again. He has taken your pain medication and not sent it.... maybe I can jump to conclusions like 'need an answer' did and say the doctor is taking the medication himself and he is addicted????

Assumptions dont help. Getting you comfortable and pain free and on the right treatment is the goal here.

Take a friend along, ask the questions, if you dont get satisfactory answers, then seek a second opinion. Maybe it isnt your fault, but a fault of the doctor in question.

After all.... we are all human. sometimes everyone needs to be reminded of that.

NOW DIE ?","Hi,
I am so sorry that you are going through this.  Unfortunately, I think most people who have chronic medical problems have had similar experiences (I know I have) and of course, I do not think you should give up.  I totally understand wanting to give up because I have felt that way after being treated by incompetent physicians, rude and condescending staff, etc.  But remember, this is your life and you have to try to hang in there with this.  YOU know that your seizures are ""real,"" it's just going to be a question of getting to the right person.  I know you feel like you've tried and tried, but it might just be the next doctor you talk to.  

I know you are upset and I don't exactly understand what you are saying, but most (good) psychiatrists know that many of the medications that they give can cause symptoms like seizures and tremors, etc.  It seems like they should be able to clearly see what you are saying (as I understand it):  you were misdiagnosed with a mental illness, given medication which caused temporal lobe epilepsy and that now temporal lobe epilepsy is your ""main"" diagnosis; not the mental illness.  I hope I'm understanding you properly.

Your situation sounds so stressful, I don't even know where to start with how to help you.  For example, I think you could be helped SO much by a support group for people with epilepsy/seizures.  You are probably already familiar with the epilepsy foundation.  I put the link below.  They have a place on there where you can locate support in your area.  Then, maybe at the support group, you may find someone who thinks they have the greatest, most caring neurologist in the world and you could try to see that person.

I'm thinking that maybe when these physicians see your chart and see all of the mental health diagnoses, they are, like you said, ""writing you off"" to a degree - it does still happen unfortunately.  You've probably already done this, but in the visit, I would bring my films (x-rays/ C.T.'s, etc.) and whatever documentation you have that you have temporal lobe epilepsy as your primary diagnosis.

In the broad scheme of things, it probably doesn't really matter if they are treating you for a mental illness or for the epilepsy as long as you get the treatment you need.  Like I said, a psychiatrist COULD be the right person for the job.  I don't know.

I guess I don't have any answers, but I wanted to reach out to you mainly to tell you to get some rest, maybe take a little break from doctors (I do that some times) and then maybe things will look a little more optimistic to you.

I couldn't tell from your question if you were just very frustrated and were saying, ""now die?"" or if you really meant it.  Because I am a social worker, I need to make sure that if any time you feel like you might hurt yourself or someone else, you should either go to the emergency room and/or call the 24-hour crisis line where you live.  I put a link to the national suicide/crisis hotline below.  Calling either of these numbers DOES NOT MEAN that you are crazy or suicidal.  It means you need someone to talk to about your frustrations; someone who won't judge you and who will help you get through the night.

Please take care of yourself.

In some women the symphisis pubis can actually separate, and this is very painful. A supportive belt may help with this - check with your doctor.

As for stripping your membranes... You as a patient have a right to refuse any treatment and the doctor must respect that; however, the doctor can choose not to honor your request for a treatment that he/she deems inadvisable.

Stripping your membranes is likely to stimulate labor if you are really on the verge of going into labor anyway; at 38 1/2 weeks, that may be unlikely. It can also increase your risk of infection and of premature rupture of membranes, either of which could cause all kinds of problems.

104,4106109,HIV Seroconversion?,"I had a possible exposure to HIV 11 weeks ago this thursday. I had a test at 9 weeks and 3 days which came up negative. Obviously I will be having another test at the 12 week mark but just wondered about the following.
At 8 weeks I had acute tonsilitis. If this was a sign of HIV infection and seroconversion would this mean that my body would be making antibodies and that the test at 9.5 weeks should have picked it up. In other words can i assume that the tonsilitis was just that and not in fact a symptom of HIV infection.
I have read that normally signs of infection appear within 5 weeks of contact. is this true? 
Also does anyone know the percentage of those who show negative at 9.5 weeks but positive at 12? 
Am worrying myself stupid here so would be grateful for anyone who can put my mind at rest.

Many thanks","Ok, relax.  I'm going to lay it out for you.  If you had a test at 9 weeks, then I'm fairly confident you are negative.

The average time it takes for someone to develop detectable antibodies on an HIV Elisa test is 25 days.  94% of people have detectable antibodies after 56 days of infection.  97% of people have detectable antibodies after 90 days of infection.  The remaining 3% can take up to six months mainly because they have an immune system disorder (leukemia, etc.).

I volunteer at an HIV testing clinic.  I will tell you that everyone I have seen was detectable anywhere from 2 weeks to 8 weeks post exposure.  Make sure you are tested via a blood sample rather than oral specimen.  The blood test is slightly more accurate.  

You cannot diagnose HIV based on symptoms alone...you will drive yourself crazy.  A test at 9 weeks is a HUGE indicator that you are almost certainly negative.

Sounds like you probably have tonsillitis.  Get some antibiotics and you should be fine.

This is a valuable lesson for you.  Be careful and always use protection.",HIV Seroconversion,,,,,,,,Am worrying myself stupid here,HIV,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes: Also does anyone know the percentage of those who show negative at 9.5 weeks but positive at 12?,"Yes: Am worrying myself stupid here so would be grateful for anyone who can put my mind at rest.

107,3027068,Child has unexplained fever?,"My 4yr old daughter has been getting unexplained high fevers (104-105) for more than 1, 1/2 year now. A year ago we took her to the ER while she had a high fever and they kept her in the hospital for 12 days and ran many tests, multiple blood test, lymph node biopsy, bone marrow biopsy just to name a few. They could not find any cause for the fever. She also suffers from extreme joint pain and rashes when she gets the fever. They put her on prednisone (steroid) a yr ago at a high dose and the symptoms got better right away. We were told that she has FUO (Fever of unknown origin)which might be caused by a hyperactive immune system. The prednisone was supposed to control her immune system and bring it down to behaving normally. Since about 3 months ago they started reducing her dose and all of sudden all the symptoms are back. They increased the dose slightly and seems to help the symptoms.

109,1360556,hemorrhoids  and blood poisoning?,"Another weird question I can't find an answer for on any website:
A lot of people have hemorrhoids bad enough that they will bleed when they go to the bathroom. 
Now, this means that fecal matter passes by a wound, an opening in a vein. The fecal matter is alive with bacteria that can, if they get into your system, cause all kinds of conditions. Yet I have never heard of people getting sick. Wouldn't you expect something like blood poisoning to happen? Feces and open, bleeding wounds aren't supposed to mix well. 
I am obviously missing something here, but I just can't figure it out. Statistically, you just would have to expect people to infect themselves occasionally.","You make a very good point. One of the most common bacteria in the digestive tract is E. Coli. People get food poisoning from this, so logically a bleeding hemorrhoid or fissure should cause blood poisoning, but like you, I have never heard of this happening. I can only speculate as to why this is, but blood is nature's way of cleaning a wound. Perhaps since the hemorrhoid is actively bleeding during a bowel movement it keeps the wound clean and doesn't allow the bacteria to enter the blood vessel. Also the body is remarkably resilient and I would assume that if you had a tear or hemorrhoid, the bodies natural defenses would ""kick in"" increasing the number of white blood cells to destroy any bacteria that did manage to get into the system. It is definitely something to consider.",hemorrhoids  and blood poisoning,,,,,,,,Wouldn't you expect something like blood poisoning to happen?,hemorrhoids  and blood poisoning,,,,,A lot of people have hemorrhoids bad enough that they will bleed when they go to the bathroom. ,hemorrhoids  and blood poisoning,,,,,"I am obviously missing something here, but I just can't figure it out.",hemorrhoids  and blood poisoning,,,,,,"Yes: I am obviously missing something here, but I just can't figure it out.

So, u know the questionnaires given during the 1st visit? Well, I�ve always had a hard time answering the questions involving loss of energy, loss of interest, ect,  bcause I have always had few/too many interests; have a difficult time making friends, or keeping them once I made them; turn down others invitations to events bcause I don�t have energy to do them- even as a kid I hated spending time after school doing things bcause I much rather be at home or didn�t want to be away from home so long.  

Once a therapist suggested I�d been depressed since childhood, but I quickly dismissed her. But recently I�ve been thinking she was right. So I guess my ? is: do u think I�m just lazy by nature, anti-social by nature, or was that therapist on to something and do u think it�s possible I�ve had depression since childhood?","If a therapist doesn't find a label for you, they can't continue to treat you, or get paid. Although I often work closely with them, I also sometimes wonder why they constantly feel the need to ALWAYS find a diagnosis, instead of just saying, ""This person has a different personality than most other people. Nothing wrong with them. Just not the norm."" So you're not the social butterfly. Some people prefer and enjoy spending their time fishing on a stream by them selves, instead of bumping shoulders at a party. Some people prefer having one GOOD friend, instead of a Roladex full of pals.  Does that make them antisocial?

Maybe you noticed these things since childhood because they are your personality, not because something's been 'wrong' with you since you were a child?

I think you're asking an excellent question. Unfortunately, in these times of 'everyone's got some psychological problem that needs treatment' you'll probably be hardpressed to find anyone willing to say it's just the way you are. 

A better question may be, are YOU, or can you be, happy with your life? Do you have activities that you enjoy, even if they're things you do alone? Are you depressed because you feel unhappy with your life, or are you unhappy because you feel you need to be 'like everyone else'? Sometimes I wonder that so many people are labeled depressed, etc., because NO ONE fits the current model of the norm. Of course, no one gets rich, if they just tell people that, tell them to enjoy being different, don't prescribe them drugs, and tell them they need to learn to love them selves as they are because they don't need any more visits.",Depression,,,,"Well, I�ve always had a hard time answering the questions involving loss of energy, loss of interest, ect,  bcause I have always had few/too many interests; have a difficult time making friends, or keeping them once I made them; turn down others invitations to events bcause I don�t have energy to do them ",Depression,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Once a therapist suggested I�d been depressed since childhood, but I quickly dismissed her.",Depression,,,"Yes: do u think I�m just lazy by nature, anti-social by nature, or was that therapist on to something ","Yes: Well, I�ve always had a hard time answering the questions involving loss of energy, loss of interest, ect,  bcause I have always had few/too many interests; have a difficult time making friends, or keeping them once I made them; turn down others invitations to events bcause I don�t have energy to do them- even as a kid I hated spending time after school doing things bcause I much rather be at home or didn�t want to be away from home so long.

138,608096,Compulsive Eating Disorder?,"I know that I have this disorder. All that I do, especially when nobody is around, is eat. I cannot stop it when I eat. Sometimes I will eat over 3,000 calories in one sitting. What is wrong with me? Do any doctors know what causes this? What are the treatment options, and can it be conquered without the expense of a therapist/physciatrist/phscoth... 

I have also had anorexia nervosa, so it is not surprising that I have another eating disorder. What is causing all of this? How can I get my life back in the balance?

Thank you for the responses. It may mean more than you'll ever know.","you may have the disorder called binge eating. when you eat that many calories in such a short amount of time you probably feel like you have no control over it. this feeling leads you to eat more and feel guilty afterwards. this can lead to bulimia if not fixed fast! what makes you feel like you have to eat is the anticiaption of the food and it makes you not care about what you will feel like after eating too much.  most of the food you eat is probably junk food and this is because you may have felt deprived earlier. it is a vicious cycle. if you find yourself eating alone in private this is a sign that you may be embarassed about it and that you may be eating for emotional problems. i am actually goin thru something similar but i told myself im goin to end it tonight. think to yourself that you are not a prisoner of food. You are in charge of your actions and what you eat. The food will always be there you can choose to eat it or not. Also wen you feel like binging stop yourself before hand. and think am i really hungry or not? if not what do i really want? and wen you are reaching for the food stop for a second and ask if that food will make you feel satisfied and happy afterward...most likely it will make you feel depressed and guilty. understand that food cannot fill an emotional void. eating more of it will only make things worse. when you feel like stuffing your mouth sit down take a few snacks out lay them on the table. ask yourself all these questions. and if you still want to eat, eat very very SLOWLY. soon you might realize that the food will not satisfy you. Then after the first few bites you wont crave it. Eat  balanced heatlhy  meals so you wont feel deprived. The main reasons for binging is low self esteem. you put too much value on weight and appearance. Know that beauty is in the eye of the beholder and your beauty is only true when you accept it. Learn to appreciate your body and all the wonderful things it does. No matter what your weight is or how skinny you are if you dont believe in your own beauty you will never be content. you can end the cycle now its all in the mind. best of luck!",Compulsive Eating Disorder,,,,How can I get my life back in the balance?,anorexia nervosa,,,"All that I do, especially when nobody is around, is eat.

A 1 week old baby will make you feel like you do nothing but nurse.  That is how you bring in your supply.  At this point, you should be nursing AT LEAST every 2 hours.  Nursing more is good.  Follow your baby's lead.  Know that breastmilk digests in about 90 mins and that your baby's tummy is about the size of her fist.

I wouldn't worry about a supply problem at this point.  Honestly, you don't have one.  :-)  What you're experiencing is normal.  Just nurse, nurse, nurse and nurse some more.  That is the best way to boost supply and it is what you and your baby need to do right now.

I was wondering about what exactly AS is, what it intails, why I never noticed anything, what I could do to help/be supportive, what kind of treatments she might have to deal with, and such.  Also, she's almost 17 and I heard that most people are diagnosed before they're teenagers, like when they're little kids.  One more thing, what does As have to do with Autism/what are the differences?","Asperger's Syndrome is a mild form of Autism.  You said your friend was strange.  Those behaviors that make her strange are probably the symptoms of Asperger's.  She probably says things without thinking about the consequences of what she is saying.  She probably has some trouble with humor, tells jokes that really aren't funny or doesn't laugh at funny jokes until other people around her laugh.  She may display emotions that don't fit with the situation.  By the way, kids who have undiagnosed Asperger's are generally called weird by thier peers.  

She may start taking medication and will probably start counseling.  Ask her what she wants you to do.  She will know best how to be supportive.",Asperger's Syndrome,,,,,,,,,,,," I never really noticed anything differnt about her, I mean she's strange, unique really, but that's what makes her so cool.  ~~~",A really good friend of mine was just diagnosed with AS,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Yes: I was wondering about what exactly AS is, what it intails, why I never noticed anything, what I could do to help/be supportive, what kind of treatments she might have to deal with, and such. ; One more thing, what does As have to do with Autism/what are the differences?","Yes: what I could do to help/be supportive, what kind of treatments she might have to deal with, and such.

157,1887825,"Do I have an arrhythmia, nervous system problem?","Six weeks ago I had a tachy brought on by lack of sleep (50 hrs) and taking in tons of caffeine (1600mg in 12 hrs).  I have been to tons of doctors, cardiologists, oncologists and have been through tons of tests.  The only thing they have found so far is a slight mitral valve leak.  This could not be causing my heart rate to jump from 60-65 at rest to 100-110 as soon as I stand up.  My heart races with minimal physical exertion and all they found with all these tests was a slight valve leak?  I bought a $50 heart rate monitor and found the 40 to 50 beat jump on my own.  I have told every doctor I have seen about this before testing it on my own and none of them has been concerned about it.  They are telling me that I am in perfect health and do not have an arrhythmia.  Could I have messed up my nervous system?  When my heart started beating really fast I thought I was having a heart attack and panicked.  I have read that going through trauma like that can cause this.  Thoughts?","You mention that you have seen several doctors and had several tests, but have you been to a Electrophysiologist ? This is a cardiologist who only specializes in diseases and disorders relating to arithmia's.While there may be several causes to your symptoms sometimes the only way to find out difinitavly what may be causing these fluxuations in your heart rate are two tests,one is what they simply call a tilt table test.simply put they strap you down to a table (only so you won't fall) and they monitor your vitals laying completly flat and start to tilt the table both forward and backwards (as if they were tipping you up side down)this is often done when your sypmtoms are caused when you go from sitting to standing.this could be caused also by a sudden drop in blood pressure from standing,the other test is is a Electrophysiology (E.P. Study)
The procedure involves inserting a catheter  a narrow, flexible tube  attached to electricitymonitoring electrodes, into a blood vessel, often through a site in the groin or neck, and winding the catheter wire up into the heart. The journey from entry point to heart muscle is navigated by images created by a fluoroscope, an x-ray-like machine that provides continuous, live images of the catheter and heart muscle. Once the catheter reaches the heart, electrodes at its tip gather data and a variety of electrical measurements are made. These data pinpoint the location of the faulty electrical site. During this electrical mapping, the cardiac arrhythmia specialist, an electrophysiologist, may instigate, through pacing (the use of tiny electrical impulses), some of the very arrhythmias that are the crux of the problem. The events are safe, given the range of experts and resources close at hand and are necessary to ensure the precise location of the problematic tissue.

Once the damaged site or sites are confirmed, the specialist may administer different medications or electrical impulses to determine their ability to halt the arrhythmia and restore normal heart rhythm. Based on this data, as well as information garnered before the study, sometimes the specialist will proceed to place an implantable cardioverter device (ICD) or a pacemaker or will perform radiofrequency ablation. In any case, the information proves useful for diagnosis and treatment.

Throughout the procedure, the patient is sedated but awake and remains still. Patients rarely report pain, more often describing what they feel as discomfort. Some watch the procedure on monitors and occasionally ask questions. Others sleep. The procedure usually takes about two hours. The patient remains still for four to six hours afterward to ensure the entry point incision begins to heal properly. Once mobile again, patients may feel stiff and achy from lying still for hours. 

I have several arythmia disorders that i was born with and have been through these tests litterally over 50 times in my life,and while it may sound scary and painful it isn't ,you will receive sedation and pain medicine.Plus the info they can learn from these procedures in some instances can be life saving.Now i'm not saying you may have something life threatning.it may very well be something as simple as anxiety related but if it is bothersome enough that it scares you as much as it seems to i think i would see one of these doctors just to be on the safe side.","arrhythmia, nervous system problem",,,,,,,,When my heart started beating really fast I thought I was having a heart attack and panicked.,my heart started beating really fast,,,,,,,,,,,,, I have told every doctor I have seen about this before testing it on my own and none of them has been concerned about it.

It sounds as if you have had excellent medical care, ruling out many possible causes for what you are feeling.

In this type of allergy even the fumes from peanuts, almonds or any nut can be fatal, an allergy is not dose dependant meaning it does not matter how much peanut but simply the presence of them. You have to do what you are doing and take charge because everyone else does not understand and that can be fatal. I hope you have all the antihistamines, and an Epi-pen on hand just in case he does eat peanuts. This will provide a window of time to get him to the ER. In time your son will be old enough to take care of himself, if others around you are so dense, then keep them away from your son. I heard a story about a kid who was extremely allergic and ate a piece of cake with no nuts, but the knife used to cut his cake was used on another cake that did have peanuts.

In general, the term ""hammer toe"" describes a buckling of any of the toe joints. Joints at the end or middle of the toe, as well as the joint near the ball of the foot, may be affected. Toe joints usually curl because of a muscle imbalance or tight tendons. Hammer toes vary in severity and in the number of joints and toes involved.

Types of Hammer Toes
Hammer toes may be flexible or rigid, depending on the joint's ability to move. A flexible joint may become more rigid as you age.The doctor will examine all your toes, testing whether or not buckled joints can be moved. Your feet will also be checked for any skin changes. Corns (a buildup of dead skin cells) often form between curled toes or on top of buckled joints where shoes rub. If irritated, corns may turn into open wounds and become infected.If your symptoms are mild, changing shoes may be all the treatment you need. If your symptoms are severe, surgery may be needed. The type of procedure often depends on whether your toe joints are flexible or rigid.

Unfortunately, from what I read, it sounds like the only treatment is surgery (since you said it wasn't her shoes).

I love him so much and I know he really wants to change but what other options are there?","I once dated a very obese man, and wondered this myself.  In the end, I realized that he did not want to change.  There was nothing I could do for him, he had to want to do it himself.  We ended up breaking up, because he refused to do anything to change his unhealthy habits and that is not how I wished to live my life.  Hopefully, your boyfriend really wants to change his lifestyle not just to please you, but for his own health and well being.  In the end, if he doesn't really want to do it for himself, then nothing you do will help him.

That being said, there are some things you can do.  Number one, of course, is to be very supportive of him.  He will have bad days now and then, and you both have to work through it.

The best place to start is to look at his current routine and pick a few small changes at a time so the change is not too drastic.  This is not a temporary diet, but a lifestyle he should be able to really live with in the long run.

Does he eat breakfast?  Studies have shown that people who eat breakfast are able to lose weight and keep it off.  I recommend a low calorie/high fiber/high protein/low sugar cereal with skim milk.  I like cinnamon shredded wheat or quaker oatmeal squares.  Also include some fruit, like a banana.

For lunch, he currently eats a sandwich and chips?  Does he bring it or buy it from a place like Togos or Subway?  Either way, can he switch to wheat bread instead of white?  Switching to low fat mayo or using mustard instead will save a lot of calories.  Also, skip the cheese.  Turkey is a good lean source of protein, but lean ham or roast beef isn't all that bad.  Just stay away from meatballs or balogna or other fatty deli meats.  Also, put more veggies on it, like lettuce, tomato, and other things.  Instead of chips, could he have an apple or something like that?  At least choose a lower fat variety of chips, such as sunchips or those Baked potato chips.

If he is starved when he gets home, then I'd say he needs to have a snack in the afternoon.  Ideally, something with protein.  Maybe he could bring a protein bar to work?  There are a bunch of good ones out there by South Beach Diet, SlimFast, and Special K has a new protein bar as well.

For dinner, try fixing some grilled chicken, veggies, and brown rice or something similar.  It needs to contain lean protein, some kind of veggies (ask him which are his favorites so he'll actually eat them), and a complex carbohydrate with lots of fiber.  Also, drinking water instead of soda will make a HUGE difference.

As for the walking, I would say that's an excellent start.  It's something you can do together and get into the habit of daily exercise.  If he has injuries, it might not be a good idea to push him too much too soon.  Maybe try to increase the speed or duration of the walks a little every week.  You might try signing up to walk a 5K race in the spring, so he has a goal in mind to work towards.  Consult a doctor before you do anything too strenuous though.",lose weight,,,,"The thing is that it's very hard to get him movtivated not the first week or the second but as time goes by he loses interest in trying to change his eating habits, he feels that everything is against him.",boyfriend lose weight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,what other options are there?,"The thing is that it's very hard to get him movtivated not the first week or the second but as time goes by he loses interest in trying to change his eating habits, he feels that everything is against him.",,,,,"Yes: Hopefully, your boyfriend really wants to change his lifestyle not just to please you, but for his own health and well being.

The results from the x-ray and cat-scan said i had a generous amount of stool in my colon. I had a colonosopy las t year to emove 3 pile-ups. What do i do now? Nothing works!","First the important thing is to talk to your doctor.

Next, don't take laxatives because your intestines (smooth involuntary muscle) will learn to rely on them.

It is important to increase your fiber intake - soluble and insoluble.  Soluble fiber (like the white/yellow part of an apple) makes your stool soft, and insoluble fiber (the apple peel) irritates the intestines and stimulates movement (peristalsis).

There are fiber supplements - if you intend to use those be certain to take enough water, otherwise that too can contribute to an obstruction.  There are bran cereals that are easy to eat - for example all bran has half a day's fiber in 1/3 cup of cereal.  Sprinkle that on a salad instead of bacon bits, mix it into muffins for extra fiber...etc.  Increase your intake of vegetables too.

You could end up with a nasty bout of diverticulosis which may also land you in surgery, and you only have so much bowel that can be removed.  You could also end up with a colostomy bag.

I have a three year old and I can't imagine her going through life without siblings. IVF shouldn't be necssicary if I have concived and have a child. I have alson had two miscarriages in the past two years not related to the blocked tubes.This is really bothering me can I get some advice?","IVF (in vitro fertilization) treatment; IUI, ICSI and Laparoscopic surgery is very cheap in India. The cost is very low and the medical services are very good in India.

My cousin and her husband got their IVF treatment in India through the Forerunners Healthcare in India and is all praise for this company. She is a known case of PCOS.She is a very happy mother of a baby boy now. She just paid 2500 pounds for the full IVF treatment in India for which she was quoted 8000 pounds in private setup in UK.

Forerunners Healthcare is very famous in India. I read a lot about them in the newspapers. I have also read about a Chinese couple who planned surrogacy through the Forerunners Healthcare. They arrange financing for USA, Canadian, UK and other international patients who plan to have surgery and infertility treatment like IVF, IUI, and ICSI abroad for low price. They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. There are huge cost savings. As a doctor I personally believe that surgery and treatment  can be easily handled in India, as the quality of healthcare available In India is simply best in the world. The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star.

13,2825139,Sinus Headaches & Root Canals?,"I have several questions.  First of all, I have really, really bad sinus'; everyone in my family does.  So, lately ( the past week or so ), I have been getting really bad sinus headaches.  I have recently had some dental work done ( 2 root canals and a temporary filling ) and I have noticed that whenever I get those really bad sinus headaches, it makes the whole left side ( the same side that I recently had a root canal and a temporary filling done ) of my face and jaw hurt; it doesn't necessarily make the tooth that had the root canal hurt or the tooth that was filled.  But definitely my face and jaw so it sometimes feels as if those two teeth are hurting...does that make sense?
 
Secondly, at my last dentist visit ( about a month and a half ago ), I had a root canal done and on another tooth, I had a cavity; not a deep cavity but a cavity.  So, after my dentist did the root canal, he put some medicine in the other tooth and sealed it up.  He said he wanted to watch that tooth to see if that one would have to have a root canal also.  My question is...how can you tell if it needs to have a root canal or not? It doesn't seem swollen or sensitive or anything like that...like I have been brushing it for awhile now and it doesn't hurt or anything like that.  How long after he put the medicine in can you tell if it should have a root canal or not?  What are the symptoms? 
 
Lastly and this is kind of embarrassing but...ever since I have begun dental work ( after 10 years or so of not going to the dentist ), I have noticed that I have begun to drool more than usual.  Now, I used to drool...does that have anything to do with it?  Does the recent dental work have anything to do with it? 
 
Thanks in advance!!","well  firstly coming to ur sinusitis problem : 

             as u have mentioned that sinusitis happens to b present among all ur family members , that might b the major cause for u  r sinusitis or any infections in ur nasal mucous membrane .

secondly coming to the relationship between sinusitis and ur root canal treated teeth , it's no ways linked in ur case , b'coz sinusitis as a result of dental origin occurs because if any infections or injudicious instrumentationperforating the sinus occuring or  carried out in the upper jaw and remember in ur case both r.c treated teeth are present in the  the right sided lower jaw and is simply impossible to have sinusitis because r,c treated lower teeth. 
 
more over ur sinusitis occurs on the left side , and ur jaw pains on left side and is simply b'coz u over load ur left side of ur jaw 


and lastly temporarily filled teeth , th infection may b very close to th pulp of teeth , in such instances we put calcium hydroxide dressing in the teeth allowing to form calcified tissue shielding the pulp from infection , if it happens there is no need for r.c.t , if calcifeid tissue fails to form after placement of medication and infection has reached the pulp then we do r.c.t

  symptoms of a patient to go for  r.c.t 

 severe sharp which gets excruciated up on taking cold and hot beverages , severe nocturnal pain , postural pain , th epain doesn't get relieved on medication and persists for longer time.

 there is no relation beween drooling of saliva and dental treatment , excessive drooling of saliva is a symptom of oral submucous fibrosis , facial palsy and rabies, nothing to get worried in ur case

You cannot cut down a tree by cutting off its branches, you have to go for its trunk and its root. Sometimes we only cut branches, sometimes we cut off the trunk, but if you don't take out the roots, the tree always grows back.

The obvious suggestion is to go see a therapist. However, that alone will not do it. It is important to seek outside support, bulimia groups and family support are important. If family is not an option, seek friends. The more shame you have, the more you will hide it and feed into the disease.

I went through the same thing, fatigue, temperature, aching, and dizziness. I had my employer prescribe an antibiotic then had a root canal (RCT). The antibiotic is a temporary solution, it will not take care of this problem permanently. If it is a wisdom tooth, you simply need an extraction. But only a dentist can make a proper diagnosis. It is possible to die from an infection like this, but those are extreme cases. The only way to take care of your problem is to see a Dentist, have a radiograph, and exam. They will make an appropriate treatment plan. Check your area, see if they have medicaid offices, free dental clinics in place, or clinics that have a sliding scale fee.

33,3964269,Does anyone have advice for a person considering a relationship with someone with Herpes HSV I II?,"I am having a difficult time getting comfortable with the fact that my girlfriend has HSV I and II(and I do not).  I am afraid, knowing that if I choose to stay in this relationship, I will eventually end up getting it as well...and there is no way to know how my body will react to the virus'.  Right now I am viewing the virus as a magnifying glass that makes small concerns seem like larger ones, because it is a huge commitment just to try to see if the relationship will be successful.  The relationship would already have more than normal amounts of stressors because of geographical issues(I'd have to move a long distance to be with her) and other reasons.  We have been doing the long-distance dating which is great, but distance makes the heart grow fonder as well.  I feel like a very bad person for having these feelings, but I'm trying to get a grasp on things, so please help if you have any insights.","I agree with the last answer but wanted to say one thing.  I was in a similar situation as you and knowing that my girlfiend had HSV 2 I decided to stay with her.   I used a condom for several months and never got it.  Recenlty we got engaged and have been having unprotected sex.  I now have the HSV 2 virus and to be honest with you, I really never ever think about it.  I honestly don't see what the big deal is. I get an OB maybe once very 3-4 months the size of a pea on my inner thigh....I put a bandaid on it, take medicine and it's gone in a couple of days.   It doesn't affect my life in any way and I feel like the luckiest person alive for having my fiance.  I would have done the same thing 1000 times over again.  So I guess the question you have to ask yourself is...  do you love her and can you see yourself being with her forever....if so,  I think the answer is very simple.  If not, but you think the relationship has potential to be something great then you just have to be careful.   The last thing I would do would be to not be with her because of this despite how you feel about her.      By the way,  you aren't a bad person for feeling this way.

please could someone help me on this 

serious answers only","Hi, if you feel you need a second opinion, then seek it. Did you know that antibiotics will run the natural immune system down if on them too long, I mean course after course after course. The body needs to fight certain infections for itself to be able to build a strong immune system.
A young child can be prone to chest infections if drinking lots of milk, cut back a little and give lots of fluids to help flush any infection through the body. You can get infant vitamin tablets maybe you should consider this and keep to recommended daily dosage as overdosing on vitamins can cause serious side effects.
Be sure to give your child a healthy balanced diet and not just junk. Lots of carrots and veggies and fruit. 
Don't give them too many bananas as they cause constipation in the very young. 
He does sound exceedingly tired but his weight loss could be growing into a boy from a baby, there is a hell of a change in the body form. I know as my son did the same as his baby legs become ladder legs....very tall and the taller they are going to be be the more likely they will suffer with growing pains.
Lots to consider before making a self diagnosis of Leukemia.
A growing child can have growing pains, a growing child can also be prone to ailments but their diet will help to make a difference as well as a good bedtime routine.
If your concerns or your childs health doesn't improve then DO get the second opinion. Better to be safe than sorry, but don't panic and think the worst, look at it from all angles especially the normality of a childs growth patterns. I have had seven to learn by and each are different but there was a pattern in the growing pains for the tall and at certain ages. Body changes as they grow which can be quite frightning for a parent who isn't aware of how fast they can change, height weight etc. Sometimes you see the weight loss but miss how tall they have become, understand?

Good luck, and I pray your child will get healthy soon.

44,3494971,I have had 4 miscarriages in a row in the past year...?,"I am 34.  I had my first son when I was 19, he is 15 now.  I had a miscarriage 4 years ago.  3 years ago I was diagnosed with diabetes...and I am well controlled.  I got pregnant 3 months after my diagnosis and delivered a healthy baby boy who is now 20 months old.
I have had 4 miscarriages in the past year.  As soon as I miss my period and get a positive test...hours later I miscarry.  It is horrible.  Can anyone tell me what in the world might be going on?  My progesterone was 13 this time and my doctor said she likes to see it at 20.  So I was on the suppsitories for a week and I did not bleed and was so happy.  Then I went to have my blood drawn and my HCG did not double not one time.
Last year I had to have methotrexate because the baby would not fully come out.  I really need some answers...it just doesn't make sense.","Chlorinated hydrocarbons (CHCs) are ubiquitous persistent substances that are incorporated into the body via ingestion, inhalation, and transcutaneously. Cell and animal studies have shown that CHCs are stored in different organs, especially the fatty tissue; exhibit hormonelike activity; and induce immunological changes (1-5). Miscarriages, fetal malformations, and growth retardation were observed in women with occupational exposure to chlorinated hydrocarbons or accidental CHC poisoning (6-10). 
In women with repeated miscarriages, intensive diagnostics allow the identification of a definite cause in some cases only, such as, for example, chromosomal, uterine, or hormonal disorders. In the majority of miscarriages, however, the cause remains unknown, so that discrete hormonal or immunological disorders are assumed. Therefore, further factors must be identified that may affect female fertility and play an etiological role in the pathogenesis of repeated miscarriages. In a previous cross-sectional study of an unselected group of 322 infertile women, increasing blood dichlorodiphenyldichloroethene (DDE) levels were significantly associated with a decreasing conception rate and increasing pentachlorophenol (PCP) concentrations with an increasing miscarriage rate (11). 

We conducted this observational study to detect a possible etiological role of chlorinated hydrocarbons in the pathogenesis of repeated miscarriages. CHC levels of women with repeated miscarriages were compared with those of a reference population. Furthermore, women with primary versus secondary miscarriages, women with early versus late miscarriages, and women with hormonal or immunological disorders as causes of repeated miscarriages versus women with idiopathic repeated miscarriages were investigated in order to detect possible differences between these different types of repeated miscarriages. The working hypothesis was that an increased body burden of CHC may be an important etiological factor in repeated miscarriages. We therefore expected to detect increased CHC levels in women with repeated miscarriages in comparison to the reference population. We also investigated possible effects of low-level CHC exposure on hormonal and immunological parameters, which may also play an etiological role in repeated miscarriages. The long-term effects of CHC levels with respect to further conceptions and the outcome of pregnancies were also observed. We must stress, however, that this is an observational study conducted to detect possible associations and to create new working hypotheses for controlled studies. 


Material and Methods
Subjects. We determined CHC levels in addition to the usual diognostics in 89 women with a history of at least two miscarriages who attended the Clinic of Reproductive Endocrinology between 1989 and 1993. Miscarriages in women who had never delivered a baby are defined as primary miscarriages (n = 65). A history of miscarriages following the delivery of at least one baby with the same partner defines secondary miscarriages (n = 24). Sixty women complained of early miscarriages (by the 12th week of gestation), and 5 women complained of late miscarriages (13th-25th week of gestation). Twenty-four women had a history of both types.

47,1510808,Can eating healthy or drinking energy drinks reduce ADD/ADHD symptoms?,"Or having a good night's sleep?

From my own observations, it seems that I tend to be more focused and pay attention better after eating or doing certain things.
When I don't have a good night sleep I have difficulty hearing what people are saying, it's like my mind blocks them out intentionally for some reason.
If I don't eat right, I become self-absorbed and become less alert to the environment around me (bad for driving!).
If I don't drink an energy drink on a work day I am more prone to passive-aggression and holding grudges against others, and fail to be more openminded and see things from other peoples' point of view. I also have a harder time pleasing customers when I don't have an energy drink to give me the boost.

But is there any scientific reason why this is? Am I just off on everything?",I think eating less sugar and less artificial coloring and flavoring can reduce the problems associated with this disorder.

Thanks","I would have him evaluated by a pediatric specialty team at your nearest children's hospital or rehab center. My daughter was dx'd with ADD/ADHD/PDD-NOS and then High-functioning Autism by her ped and later by state funded physical and occupational therapists through early intervention. She was medicated at the school's insistence for ADHD. When that made things worse instead of better, we had her evaluated at our local pediatric rehabilitation center and learned that she was actually a perfect match for the symptoms/actions of Aspergers Syndrome and early onset bi-polar disorder. The reason the meds made things worse was that with bi-polar, you can't give just the anti-depressant, you have to do a mood stabilizer as well, or the manic symptoms will intensify and often times go out of control.

You seem to know quite a bit about it yourself.  The main criteria are

1.  Qualtitative impairment in social funcioning   -   this is not the same thing as not enjoying social encounters, which is much more likely to stem from potential issues caused by bullying.  If you can respond to emotional cues from other etc., have developed peer relationships and you gain enjoyment from interactions (at least sometimes) then you're probably OK.

2.  Restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behaviour/interest/activitiy  -  do you have these?  You didn't mention any so I assume the answer is no.  They would include a pre-occupation with parts of objects or non-cunctional routines or rituals.

3.  Clinically significant impairment in social or occupational (employment) functioning  -   can you hold down a job?  Maintain relationships?

People with Asperger's also show a delay in self-help, adaptive behaviour and curiosity, so the fact you've asked a question here in itself is a good sign.

You sound totally normal and I think you should basically ignore the poster who said you should be concerned.

68,1049932,Is it a seizure?,"My 13 year old daughter started having ""episodes"" (for the lack of a better word) about 6 months ago. She has had 3 this week though and I am scared. She is having severe chest pain with pain running down the left arm (she says like a throbbing pain), trouble beathing; like she is choking, and she passes out. When this happens she is pretty much out for 30-45 minutes. Afterward she is fine with no visible side effects. Upon taking her to the emergency room and running of tests doctors have found no cause. She is set to see a neurologist next week. Before this week she had only had 3 of these episodes total; but 3 in one week really scares me. I have not seen any common thread or trigger of these episodes.","Although I would not want to guess what is actually the problem, it doesn't sound like a seizure, at least not an epileptic seizure of any sort.  A grand mal seizure is characterized by the uncontrolled jerking and ""seizing"" of the entire body that one usually thinks of as a seizure.  There isn't usually any pain associated with it prior to the onset, although some people do report an aura of lights or such just before it happens.  After the seizure passes, the person regains control and consciousness, but they are extremely tired and sleepy, and sometimes disoriented. In petit mal seizures there is a sort of ""checking out"", usually the person stares off into space for several minutes, and comes back without realizing much has happened. There are variations, but none of them involve pain, breathing difficulties, or passing out in that sense.  So while whatever is wrong is definitely in need of being further evaluated, I would say that epilepsy is not one of the things to be a concern.
  The neurologist will likely order an MRI, CAT Scan, and several other neurological tests, along with some cardiac testing to eliminate that as a possible cause.  Until those results are all in, he likely won't be able to give you many answers.  In the meantime, though, you can ask him what sort of precautions you should take to keep her safe.  I'd imagine they wouldn't want her doing anything really physically demanding, sports or anything like that.   Hopefully you can get the answers you need fairly soon, and be able to put your mind at ease.  I'm sorry I can't offer more help than this.

The last test (ANA) is anti-nuclear antibody.  It is generally used to test for autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, commonly known as SLE or lupus.  A positive test is suggestive of the disease.  This disease is characterised by the butterfly rash over the face.  But as it's name suggests, it is a systemic disease affecting many organs.  Other blood tests for SLE may include anti-rho antibody, anti- dsDNA antibody (anti double stranded DNA antibody), C3 and C4 (complement 3 and complement 4) levels.  The diagnosis of SLE, however, is mainly clinical.  The American Rheumatology Association has a criteria for diagnosing SLE, you'll need to fulfil 4 out of the 11 criteria to be diagnosed with SLE.  Do a search on yahoo and there'll be plenty of sites with links to the criteria.

84,2104137,Confused about glucose testing?,"I am 20 weeks pregant and with my family history of diabetes (mom, g-mom, g-dad, uncle etc.= all insulin dependant) I have been checking my blood sugar often. My home tests are quite often between 180 and 250 even 4 hours after meals. I went for a GTT thurs and had not ate or drank anything in 11 hours and the test came back normal but even today my home tests are registering high. I am so CONFUSED!!! Could I still be at risk for gestational diabetes and how relevant is a gtt test?","SOUNDS LIKE YOUR HOME BLOOD SUGAR TESTING IS HIGH.  ANOTHER OPTION TO CHECKING THE ACCURACY OF YOUR MONITOR IS TO TEST IT WITH A CONTROL SOLUTION.  ASK AT THE PHARMACY IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY.  IT USUALLY COMES WITH A NEW MONITOR.

IT COULD BE THAT YOUR READINGS AT HOME ARE ELEVATED DUE TO WHAT YOU ATE.  I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT YOU ARE EATING HEALTHY, BUT IF YOU ATE SOMETHING WITH HIGH CARBS OR SUGAR, THAT COULD CAUSE THE HIGHER READING.  ALSO, STRESS IS A FACTOR.  IF YOU ARE STRESSED OUT OVER A POTENTIAL HIGH READING, THAT ALONE CAN MAKE IT READ HIGHER.  IF YOU ARE SLIGHTLY UNDER THE WEATHER, COLD LIKE SYMPTOMS, THAT TOO CAN ELEVATE THE BLOOD SUGAR.  

OCCASIONALLY, I TAKE MY MONITOR WITH ME TO THE DOCTORS.  DO A 'SIDE BY SIDE' COMPARISON TO SEE IF I GET A READING CLOSE TO THE DOCTORS OFFICE MACHINE.  ALSO, NEXT TIME YOU HAVE BLOOD DRAWN TO CHECK YOUR BLOOD SUGAR, TAKE YOUR MONITOR WITH YOU AND TEST WITH IT AT THE SAME TIME THE LAB DRAWS BLOOD.  THAT TOO WILL CHECK THE ACCURACY OF YOUR MONITOR.

He was retaining water. They had to drain 33 pounds from liquid from his abdomal area and than another  12 pounds another day. He has had a blood transfusion and every test imaginable done. He has a liver biopsy yesterday. His daughter suspects liver cancer but is waiting on the cancer specialist to confirm. What can I expect? Is he going to die soon? Is there any possibilities his condition is manageable for a certain amount of time? How long? Please no rude and cold-hearted, or sarcastic remarks and answers. With my respect.","Liver disease can be a very difficult problem to deal with for people. As long as you stay in touch with his doctors and get him all the services and care he needs, you will ensure that his condition is optimized. 

Your father has Cirrhosis. This is a chronic liver diseases (usually due to Hepatitis) where the normal liver cells are damaged and replaced by scar tissue. Basically, the amount of normal liver tissue is decreased. Liver disease is common in the US (ranked 8th as a cause of death in the United States).

Your dad's Gastroenterologist would make this diagnosis and it sounds like he is getting worked up for Cirrhosis. Without knowimg more details about him it may be hard to say but it seems unlikely that he has cancer. 
Cancer of the liver is usually diagnosed by imaging, clinical picture and labwork (serum AFP). The most common (primary) malignancy of the liver is hepatocellular carcinoma. The only treatment is liver transplant. However, this surgery is very complicated. 

You can help your father by watching his SALT intake, making sure he takes his medications and that he gets to his appointments. (Develope a close relationship with his Gastroenterologist/ Hepatologist.)

 It's very hard to have an ill parent. My father (in his early sixties) died of cancer a few years ago and it was a difficult time for my entire family.

The websites the first answerer gave you are good resources. You will find that rather than different stages, there are actually different types of MS.  Some come and go, some deteriorate.  Depending on the type your brother has, there are different expectations, including difficulty walking, talking, cognitive changes, etc.  Its a tough disease, especially since the patients are generally so young.  Your brother is lucky to have a sister like you who cares so much.  Staying on his meds, and staying out of the heat are two important factors.  There is good rehabilitation available and he should consider that in order to preserve and maintain functioning for as long as possible.  One thing I've seen with a lot of my young patients is depression.  You can imagine it would be difficult to be a young person with a diagnosis like MS.

If you are this frightened, make sure your docs, nurses and anesthesiologist all know. They can give you something to help or help you understand what's going to happen. A calm patient usually heals better than a terrified one, so they will help.

Most general anesthesia is given--at least the part that you will actually experience--in the IV. They usually tell you to count backwards from ten. Few people get to six before they're asleep. It actually feels VERY nice, like happy, dizzy, and passing out, kinda like some illegal drugs. But it lasts only a few seconds, so don't worry.

It came on really suddenly yesterday and is just getting worse.

And before you jump down my throat(please don't, cause that would really hurt right now) I went to my doctor this a.m. She prescribed penicillin, and sent a throat culture to the lab to see if it was strep.

I'm having trouble sleeping, because I'm in so much pain (tylenol is doing nothing) and I can't swallow/breath very well. 

So now, feverish, sleep deprived and obsessive (that's just my natural state, though), I'm thinking, what if I don't have strep? What if I have an STD in my throat? I've heard this is possible, but I'm not finding info about what the symptoms would be.

117,3632063,I have a friend that has diabetes and he is having a really hard time today...?,"He measured his sugar today and it was 480...REALLy high.  Right now he is sitting at home chilling out, he took the day off of work.  He has the fans blowing directly on him and hes taken a few baths to cool himself down.  He takes medicine for his disease.  I am currently not able to go and take care of him because I am at work, and I won't be off until really late tonight.  Is there anything I can tell him to do to make him feel better?  Are there any foods he can eat to take his sugar down?","My step brother is diabetic as was my step father - who incidently died at age 38 years old due to complications from diabetes and his kidney transplant.

I'm not saying that to scare you -I'm saying it because when your sugar level swings up and down - 480, then 40, then 320, then 85..ALL the time - this does damage to the renal veins in the eys and kidneys.

He MUST not only get his sugar down (which can ONLY be brought down by the correct amount of insulin and NOT food or water - but by insulin prescribed in dosage amounts for him and his body weight.) but he has to CONTROL it.  It can NOT swing like that! Dangerous - can cause strokes, heart attacks, internal organ damages.

The question is - what did he eat that put him over the edge? Sweets? Alcohol? just even a big sandwich? does he have the flu? Alot of things can affect sugar.

He DOES need to call his doctor immediately and schedule an evaluation of diet and medication to see what the right combination is for him.

My step bro uses the insulin pump with great sucess -he's one that never took care of his sugar either -with it swinging up and down - now with the pump he is better managing his diabetes - althoug he still doesn't follow the correct diet that he should - and I'm not saying it is easy to do that. I have 10lbs to lose and I can't even do that right - its HARD!! But..its IMPORTANT and diabetics can live very healthy energetic lives and grow to old age if they work cooperatively with their doctor.

You also - MUST check on him -if his sugar is out of whack so that he's not passing out and no one finds him alone..My stepuncles wife (my stepaunt if you will) her brothers died within 2 months of each other. 34 and 37 years old - both had unregulated diabetes. Both were home ALONE and had bad reactions - and no one knew. it was horrifically sad.

Again I'm not saying this to upset you -but its a serious disease that needs to be monitored. Call your friend and have him get someone over there to sit with him.

And lastly - please forgive me for saying this - but his diabetic problems can not be something you make yourself sick over -HE HAS TO DO IT FOR HIMSELF. And yes - as his friend you should encourage that he get the help he needs. We all suffered so much guilt when my stepfather died - but know what? I miss him, I love him, he was amazing - but he did it to himself...he started smoking after his kidney transplant again...he didn't exercise, he didn't watch his diet - and we lost him- its been 11 years and I still cry.

118,3694681,Re-occuring back pain.?,"Hi.
I have had lower back pain now for 5 yrs & I'm sick of it. The doctor can't find anything wrong, the chriopracter (SP) keeps popping it at the same spot, but says everything is fine. The x-rays show nothing. I do exercises recommended by the chrio, wear heating pads (which helps some), & take advil. I've had an upper & lower GI done (nothing wrong), it is not gas, constipation, or cramps. I feel better when I wear a corset, which makes me think it might be bad posture, but I'm not sure how to fix that (yes I have a large chest, but not so large that according to doc to harm me). I am 10 lbs over weight for my height, & eat healthy.  The pain starts when I get up for the day & only sitting hunched in a chair do I feel it lessen.  If I try sit-ups or curls I'm unable to move. No injuries, no accidents.I'm still able to work & function, but I would like to fix this.  Does anyone have any serious answers or suggestions?","WEbMD states. ""Some exercises can aggravate back pain. If you have low back pain, avoid:

Straight leg sit-ups. 
Bent leg sit-ups or partial sit-ups (curl-ups) when you have acute back pain. 
Lifting both legs while lying on your back (leg lifts). 
Lifting heavy weights above the waist (standing military press or bicep curls). 
Toe touches while standing.""  In fact, as you have found they can aggravate the pain. I have listed a few sites below with recommended exercises to help strengthen your low back muscles. Start out slow and do not push too fast. In addition, quit slumping. Poor posture does not help the problem and will cause other problems down the road. ""It's important that you don't let fear of pain keep you from trying gentle activity. You should try to be active soon after noticing pain, and gradually increase your activity level. Too little activity can lead to loss of flexibility, strength, and endurance, and then to more pain.

Exercises that may help reduce or prevent low back pain include:

Aerobic exercise, to condition your heart and other muscles, maintain health, and speed recovery. 
Strengthening exercises, focusing on your back, stomach, and leg muscles. 
Stretching exercises, which keep your muscles and other supporting tissues flexible and less prone to injury"" (WebMD).

125,3839125,Question about Lactose Intolerance?,"I like to drink milk, milkshakes, and eat ice cream and all the like. But about 1/2 hour to an hour or so afterward, my stomach gets all ""growly"" and i experience i guess you could say a stomach ache almost. i mean it's not like intensely painful, it's just really annoying. Also I get really gassy after drinking milk and other dairy products.

Does this mean I'm lactose-intolerant? If not, then just what the hell is wrong here? Is there a way i can relieve this stomach crap?","Yes, you and many other people (myself included) are lactose intolerant.  We lack the enzyme that helps break down lactose. Stomach and intestinal cramping and flatulence (farting) are classical signs of lactose intolerance.  There is an over the counter medication you can by at your local drug store or grocery store called LACTAID.  It has the enzyme that breaks down lactose.  You may still be a little gassy, but the cramps  will decrease or completly disappear.

they get worse and worse over the years,and i hate taking so much medicine.is there long term damage from migraines,i mean that much pressure and pain can't be good in the long run,sometimes i feel like i'm going to die from the pain.
i think sometimes this crap is going to seriously kill me,like give me an aneurism or something.can something like this happen?","Possible symptoms of migraines
Intense throbbing or dull aching pain on one side of your head or both sides. 
Nausea or vomiting 
Changes in how you see, including blurred vision or blind spots 
Being bothered by light, noise or odors 
Feeling tired and/or confused 
Stopped-up nose 
Feeling cold or sweaty 
Stiff or tender neck 
Light-headedness 
Tender scalp 

Are there different kinds of migraine headaches? 
Yes. The most common are classic migraine and common migraine.

Classic migraines start with a warning sign, called an aura. The aura often involves changes in the way you see. You may see flashing lights and colors. You may temporarily lose some of your vision, such as your side vision.

You may also feel a strange prickly or burning sensation, or have muscle weakness on one side of your body. You may have trouble communicating. You may also feel depressed, irritable and restless.

Auras last about 15 to 30 minutes. Auras may occur before or after your head pain, and sometimes the pain and aura overlap, or the pain never occurs. The head pain of classic migraines may occur on one side of your head or on both sides.

Common migraines don't start with an aura. Common migraines may start more slowly than classic migraines, last longer and interfere more with daily activities. The pain of common migraines may be on only one side of your head. 

How long do migraines usually last? 
Migraines may last from 4 to 72 hours. They may happen only once or twice a year, or as often as daily. Women are more likely to have migraines than men.

What things may set off a migraine? 
Certain things that can set off migraines in some people include the following:

Strong or unusual odors, bright lights or loud noises 
Changes in weather or altitude 
Being tired, stressed or depressed or the let-down after a stressful event 
Changes in sleeping patterns or sleeping time 
Certain foods (see the list below), especially those that contain tyramine, sodium nitrate or phenylalanine 
Missing meals or fasting 
Menstrual periods, birth control pills or hormones 
Intense physical activity, including sexual activity 

 Foods that may trigger migraines
Aged, canned, cured or processed meat, including bologna, game, ham, herring, hot dogs, pepperoni and sausage

Aged cheese

Alcoholic beverages, especially red wine

Aspartame

Avocados

Beans, including pole, broad, lima, Italian, navy, pinto and garbanzo

Brewer's yeast, including fresh yeast coffee cake, donuts and sourdough bread

Caffeine (in excess)

Canned soup or bouillon cubes

Chocolate, cocoa and carob

Cultured dairy products, such as buttermilk and sour cream

Figs

Lentils
 Meat tenderizer

Monosodium glutamate (MSG)

Nuts and peanut butter

Onions, except small amounts for flavoring

Papaya

Passion fruit

Pea pods

Pickled, preserved or marinated foods, such as olives and pickles, and some snack foods

Raisins

Red plums

Sauerkraut

Seasoned salt

Snow peas

Soy sauce
 
 What about prescription medicines? 
People with more severe pain may need prescription medicine. A medicine called ergotamine (brand name: Ergostat) can be effective alone or combined with other medicines. Dihydroergotamine (brand names: Migranal, D.H.E. 45) is related to ergotamine and can be helpful.

Other prescription medicines for migraines include sumatriptan (brand name: Imitrex), zolmitriptan (brand name: Zomig), naratriptan (brand name: Amerge) rizatriptan (brand name: Maxalt), almotriptan (brand name: Axert), eletriptan (brand name: Relpax) and frovatriptan (brand name: Frova).

If the pain won't go away, stronger medicine may be needed, such as a narcotic (brand name: Stadol nasal spray) or medicines that contain a barbiturate. These medicines can be habit-forming and should be used cautiously.

I am pretty sure you would know if it were a kidney stone, because it doesn't just go away in a day, either (personal experience)  plus you would have notice some blood in urine.

It still could have been your appendix.  You won't get the fever until it ruptures.  Acute Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix, your body is always getting inflammation, and it can get rid of it.  Your body might have done just that.  If you didn't have it removed, which sounds like your didn't.  You still could do it again.  If it happens over and over in your life.  It's called chronic appendicitis.  This usually doesn't happen, because the ER doctors usually take it out, just in case.  If it ruptures, the contents of your intestines with all its germs get into your abdominal cavity causing a massive infection that could kill you.  And, if it doesn't because you made it to the hospital soon enough, it's a mess to clean out.  So, better safe than sorry in their opinion and just remove it.

136,4104582,Midwife or OBYGN?,"Hi, I'm 40 and very happily 8 wks pregnant with our 3rd baby. With my 2 first children I was with a OBGYN who used pain relief whether a hot tub or an epid.(I used both:) but she practices far from where I now live so I'm looking for another Dr. 
My question is since I'm 40 I'm a little concerned with going with a OBYGN since I've heard that they tend to order C-sections more readily if the mother is over 40 (?). I've heard that a midwife might 
not so quickly (?) But Midwifes  don't use epid. as much as a OBGYN does (right?)  I 'd like to know that there's an option of pain relief in the form of medicine, since I was in a lot of pain with my 1st / 2nd and want to be prepared if the 3rd is the same. With my 1st 2 children I had the epid. once I had dilated  to 7. My  Dr. said that if I had  meds. before then the labor might be slowed down, thus might end with a  C-section. 
What do you think? It's been 10 yrs. since I've been  preg. so this is like the 1st time. 
Thanks in advance!","I used a midwife that was in a practice with a OB/GYN and she was WONDERFUL!  I hope and pray that she's around for every single one of my future pregnancies!  The only thing you may have to worry about is your age.  Since you're 40 (not that that's old!) you're more at risk for certain things, and although a midwife will most likely treat you, she may want to work close with a OB/GYN in case of complications.  Also, about the whole epidural thing - my midwife never once mentioned trying to make it through labor without drugs.  She encouraged me to get them if I wanted them.  It was all up to me.  She never discouraged me from having the epidural done.  As for c-sections - I think it's really a case by case thing.  I doubt a midwife is going to let you go without a c-section if you really need one.  If you're really worried about the choice that you're making, do some research and set up a few appts. to speak with some midwives.  They'll be able to answer your questions and reassure you, and I'm sure you'll feel much better about your choice once you have all of the facts.  Congratulations on your pregnancy!!!

I'm confused about an ovarian laparoscopy.  The way it was explained to me, I think my doctor just wanted to look.  I read online that laparoscopy is used just to see.  However, I have also read that if an abnormality is seen, such as a cyst, the doctor will drain them.  Also, is this what is called ""ovarian drilling""?  I heard that if I develop scar tissue, I will not be able to get pregnant.  What are the chances that I will be scarred?  Lastly, would this be for both ovaries?  
Thank you.","Polycysitic ovaries, or PCOS is a complex condition that to this day has no clear cut situations. But first as off let me address your possibilities of not being able to fall pregnant. This is not always the case. Your presonal situation will be different to every other woman with PSOC, so this is something only you and your doctor can discuss, however, more and more women who suffer from PCOS are falling pregnant. If you are in a relationship and are looking ot fall pregnant, then there are many things medically that can be done to assist, however some women dont need assistance at all.

Secondly, a Laparoscopy is a procedure that uses a ""laparoscope"" via a key hole inscision to send a camera to your ovaries to have a look.  Your Doctor may or may not remove cysts that he sees, as depending of the size and the nature of the cyst, they can often disappear over time. If he does chose to remove the cyst, it generally can be done through the same key hole inscision. 

Also, ovarian drilling, done during laparoscopy, is a procedure in which a laser fibre or electrosurgical needle punctures the ovary 4 to 10 times. This treatment results in a dramatic lowering of male hormones within days and is often performed in women who have polycystic ovary syndrome. Studies have shown that up to 80 percent of patients will benefit from such treatment.

One thing I wish to say to you is never follow 'things you have heard' as gospel for your own health. Only a health professional who knows your medical history should make calls on your personal situation. 

But I do suggest that you read health journals, or even go to www.soulcysters.com It is a support group for women with PCOS and can be a valuable resource for information.

Doctors said it is common in Japan and Canada. But this boy has never travelled to oversease countries. So they tried their best to treat him but my son died. Thank you.","Hi,

Sorry to hear about your son. 

The disease is called polyarteritis nodosa. It's a disease that causes inflammation in blood vessels which leads to their destruction. 

The disease involves many organs in the body. It can present as a self limited disease that has only skin lesions or as a severe disease that involves many organs which leads to their disfunction, and to death. 

Nothing is known at the moment about the genetics of the disease. In the USA it occurs in 9-17 out of 1,000,000 people. It usually affects people of all ages and is much more common in males than females. 

The causes of the disease are unclear as of today. There is evidence that maybe the immunologic system in the body is responsible, because when checking for values of factors in the blood that usually go up in diseases that have an immune cause, these factors go up in this disease as well. 

These include:
1. antibodies of the type endothelial COH
2. antibodies that are common in other diseases of blood vessels, called ANCA
3. There is also a connection with infection from Hepatitis virus (that causes a liver disease usually). In 30% of people with the disease the virus was found in the blood. It's possible that the body's response to the virus causes the disease.",Polyteritis Nodosa,,,,So they tried their best to treat him but my son died,son died,,,,,,,we wonder where could have the boy got the disease ,polyarteritis nodosa,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes: Whats the cause of this desease,Yes: Last August I lost a 14 year boy,,,,,Yes: Sorry to hear about your son. ,,,

INTRODUCTION � Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common cause of infertility in women [1], and is primarily characterized by ovulatory dysfunction and hyperandrogenism. The diagnosis of PCOS has life-long implications with increased risk for infertility, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and possibly cardiovascular disease. It should be considered in any adolescent girl with hirsutism, persistent acne, menstrual irregularity, or obesity.

The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents are presented here. The definition, pathogenesis, and treatment of PCOS in adolescents are discussed separately. (See ""Definition, pathogenesis, and etiology of polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents"" and see ""Treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents"").

CLINICAL FEATURES � It is important to appreciate that PCOS is a syndrome, not a disease, reflecting multiple potential etiologies and variable clinical presentations. Adolescent girls with PCOS may present with hirsutism, menstrual irregularities, obesity, acanthosis nigricans, premature pubarche, and/or precocious puberty (show figure 1). Any one of these findings may be the sole feature of the syndrome. Treatment-resistant acne, scalp hair loss, seborrhea, or hyperhidrosis also may be presenting chief complaints.

Hirsutism � Hirsutism is defined clinically as excessive sexual hair that appears in a male pattern [2]. Hirsutism is commonly graded according to the Ferriman-Gallwey system, which quantitates the extent of hair growth in the most androgen-sensitive areas (show figure 2). In adult women, a score of <8 is normal, 8 to 15 indicates mild hirsutism, and >15 indicates moderate to severe hirsutism.

Hirsutism must be distinguished from hypertrichosis, the generalized excess growth of hair that sometimes occurs on a hereditary basis, or in patients taking glucocorticoids, phenytoins, diazoxide, or cyclosporine. Hypertrichosis is distributed in a nonsexual pattern (eg, generalized distribution or more prominent distribution on the forehead or shoulders) and is not caused by excess androgen, although it may be aggravated by excess androgen.

Acne vulgaris, pattern alopecia, seborrhea, hyperhidrosis, and hidradenitis suppurativa are considered to be hirsutism equivalents [3]. Hyperandrogenism should be considered in adolescent females who have inflammatory acne that is unusual in its age of onset (before midpuberty), severity, persistence, or unresponsiveness to standard therapy.

Hirsutism and hirsutism equivalents are variably expressed manifestations of excess androgens that are present in approximately two-thirds of hyperandrogenic females [2,3]. The absence of hirsutism in approximately one-third of hyperandrogenic women appears to be because of relatively low sensitivity of their pilosebaceous unit to androgens. In addition, hirsutism may be absent in young adolescents whose hyperandrogenism has not evolved fully.

Not all hirsutism is caused by hyperandrogenism. Approximately one-half of mildly hirsute women and one-sixth of moderately hirsute women do not have androgen excess, but have idiopathic hirsutism. (See ""Evaluation of women with hirsutism"").

Ovarian findings 

Polycystic ovaries � Although PCOS in adolescents has clinical and endocrine features similar to those in adults, the detection of polycystic ovaries with ultrasonography appears to be less sensitive in adolescents (show radiograph 1) [3]. In a comparison of consecutively studied hyperandrogenic females, polycystic ovaries were found in 55 percent of adolescents and 75 percent of adults. This difference, however, may reflect the limitation of imaging virginal adolescents by the abdominal route compared with the higher-definition transvaginal route used in adults. A polycystic ovary may not develop until two or more years after menarche [4].

I have read several articles and some say it is cancer confined to the cervix and others say it is pre-cancer. My doctor seems evasive when answering questions and acts like this is no big deal. I am confused, worried, depressed and notably horrified. Please give any info regarding this topic","The word carcinoma means the cells are malignant. A prefix attached to the word carcinoma will tell you where the carcinoma is growing and the kinds of cells that are involved. An adenocarcinoma, for example, is a carcinoma made of glandular cells. When you see the word oma by itself, it means ""benign."" An adenoma refers to a clump of benign glandular cells, a fibroma refers to a clump of benign fibrous cells, and so on.

The words in situ and invasive are used in conjunction with a carcinoma or a sarcoma. In situ means ""in one place."" A carcinoma in situ is cancer that is confined to a specific area and has not spread. This is good news and means your cancer is not invasive. Invasive carcinoma is cancer that has spread to surrounding tissue, the lymph nodes, or other organs. This is not good news and means your cancer can spread.

I would suggest you seek another ob/gyn and an oncologist jsut to make sure.",Carcinoma In Situ,,Female,,,,,,"I am confused, worried, depressed and notably horrified.

#2  I bought ovulation tests (they sell cheap at Walmart and you just pee on the stick).  You can also tell when ovulation begins by the eggwhite discharge (I know thats gross but I want to help).
11 days after my period, I began using the test.  When I peed on a stick and indicated my peak ovulation, I had a lot of sex during the next three days.

The snack should be a light food, otherwise you could end up feeling nauseous which isn't good either.  Try a yogurt or (maybe) fruit.  Your body is having a problem regulating sugar.

Any hopefull suggestions?","It sounds like you are not thinking about solving one problem at a time, but focussing on them all at once, which can be stressful, overwhelming, and can worsen your depression. Here are some things you can try at home to decrease your depression. Hope this helps.

""GET OUT OF BED: 

One of the most important things you can do is get up at about the same time every morning (even week-ends). Preferably, that means about 7 a.m. or earlier. You might not feel like it but Get Up. Such regularity helps your body function more normally so you're more likely to feel normal. 

LIGHTS: 

Light helps your body function better. So turn on a lot of lights as soon as you arise. Open curtains to get more sunlight. Better yet, go outdoors into the sunshine as soon as you can. Remove any eyewear so light will enter more readily (glass cuts out some of the sun's rays). But don't stare at the sun, of course. 

MOVE: 

Be active right away -- oxygenate! That means getting up and walking around your dwelling for five or 10 minutes, or perhaps riding an exercycle. Mild exercise gets the blood flowing and transports more oxygen throughout your body (especially to your brain), helping you feel mentally alert and alive. 

MUSIC: 

Select and play some energetic, happy music as you dress and have your breakfast. The audiovisual department of most libraries has albums and tapes you can check out. 
  

BREAKFAST: 

Begin your breakfast with protein (i.e., meat, eggs, peanut butter, nuts, cheese). When you get up, your body chemistry is ready to convert food, especially protein,into longlasting energy. To balance your most important meal of the day, add an orange or other fresh fruit and whole grain cereal or whole grain bread. 

TALK WITH SOMEONE: 

One of the quickest ways to beat the blues is to interact with others. You might not feel like doing that - you'd rather avoid people when blue. So make lt easier on yourself. Talk with someone you enjoy about a subject you enjoy so there is definite give and take. 

And, force yourself to say ""hello"" to the persons next to you in class, those where you live, anyone around. 

LIMIT CAFFEINE: 

The long-term (four hours or so) effects of caffeine are depression. Try to limit coffee to no more than one cup in the morning. Coffee can make you more alert for an hour or so, but later you get an opposite reaction. Caffeine tends to increase the release of insulin in the blood, and insulin lowers the blood sugar level. When you have low blood sugar levels, you begin to feel less sure of yourself, and have low energy levels, which can lead to the blues or depression. 

LIMIT SUGAR: 

Sugar might give you an initial rush of energy, but within an hour or so the blood sugar level can become low, and when it's low you may feel low, too. 

The caffeine/sugar cycle. It's easy to get caught in the caffeine and sugar cycle -- having coffee, caffeinated soft drinks, or something with sugar every two hours or so to ""stay up."" For example, cola contains about 10 teaspoons of sugar plus caffeine equal to about half a cup of coffee. In addition to bringing on the blues, this cycle can result in dependence, poor nutrition. and obesity -- reasons to get down on yourself even more and feel blue. 

MAINTAIN FIBER: 

Fiber helps food go through your digestive system at a proper rate, giving a more constant energy supply. Highly processed foods merely provide a quick surge of energy which can be followed by depression. You can maintain fiber in your diet by eating an orange or grapefruit rather than just drinking the juice. Eat fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, and whole grain breads and cereals. 

STRESS B COMPLEX: 

Some persons report receiving help by taking a concentrated vitamin B complex. You'll find these called something like ""Stress B"" or ""B 50."" This is controversial.

She probably doesn't believe or accept herself as ill to the point she says she is.

Also, some accept themselves as ill and recover, others slowly wither away into a world of mania and insanity.

Plz ask your doctor to do these basic tests, I dont know why the CT Scan is such an abused test! Instead of doing the routine basic investigations they jump to the more hi falutin ones!

These would be the tests required to find out the root cause of your problem. Till then anything is just speculation:

-Blood tests such as CBC, electrolytes, thyroid function tests, and vitamin B-12 levels
-Imaging studies like a CT scan of the head, CT scan of the spine, MRI of the head, or MRI of the spine
-Electromyography to measure how your muscles respond to nerve stimulation
-X-ray of the affected area
-Lumbar puncture to assess for multiple sclerosis and other conditions
-Ultrasound of neck vessels to evaluate your risk for TIA or stroke

Hope that helps

I filled out a ton of forms and the Dr. said I am Bipolar.  My ""symptoms"" include severe depression, horrible money management skills, and poor decision making skills.  No Manic episodes.  I am a recovering alcoholic sober for 3 years.  For the first time in my life I was fired in February.  Due to performance issues.  I have a problem with my memory mainly that I don't have one. Also, I can't concentrate or focus.  I take six different meds and I don't feel like they are doing me any good.  I feel like since I was diagnosed BP and started taking all of these meds that everything has gone down hill.  I know you aren't a  doctor.  I just want to hear your thoughts.

If you do feel normal could you tell me what meds you are taking email me at Zanneyk@yahoo.com.","Well, if you feel like your meds aren't helping you, then perhaps you need to go back to your doctor and tell them that you don't feel your meds to be working. If they don't do anything about it, then perhaps you should seek advice from another doctor. Perhaps you need to alse be in weekly therapy sessions also- if you are not already.

Lupus is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect various parts of the body, especially the skin, joints, blood, and kidneys. The body's immune system normally makes proteins called antibodies to protect the body against viruses, bacteria, and other foreign materials. These foreign materials are called antigens. In an autoimmune disorder such as lupus, the immune system loses its ability to tell the difference between foreign substances (antigens) and its own cells and tissues. The immune system then makes antibodies directed against ""self."" These antibodies, called ""auto-antibodies,"" react with the ""self"" antigens to form immune complexes. The immune complexes build up in the tissues and can cause inflammation, injury to tissues, and pain.",,,,,,,,,"I have recently been noticing dandruff in my hair and have tried a couple shampoos, they didn't work!

With that said:  



Hepatitis C is transmitted when the blood or body fluids from an infected person enters the body of a person who is not immune to the disease.

It can be spread by:

Having sex with an infected person without a condom (though experts don't know if condoms prevent transmission or just reduce it).
Sharing drugs and needles.
Being cut by infected needles (health care workers).
Birth from a mother to a child.
Hepatitis C is not spread through food, water, or by casual contact.

Unless you are sharing razors and bodily fluids with this guy, you are not in any danger.  You could hug him, kiss him, sit on his lap, hold his hand - all of these, all day long, and you would NOT get the disease.  

It is also not a form of HIV/AIDS, they are completely different diseases. 

I think it is wonderful that you would take someone in, but you should never do anything that you are not completely comfortable with.  You and your family are absolutely safe with this person unless you start sharing needles or having sex.  

I suggest going to www.webmd.com (i've included the link to a Hep C overview), www.wikipedia.org, and asking your family doctor for advice in order to make yourself absolutely comfortable.

20,1093581,How can I deal with this myself ?,"My Mom's not well.
She has crippling arthritis. She has had it since I can remember. (I'm 19) However she also has a very very bad back. She has had several operations in the past 15 or so years, including a Spinal Fusion. However, lately due to the arthritis she has grown increasingly worse. It takes her 3 minutes to get out of the car.
She has been told that she now has 3 options. 

- Continue getting injections into her spine. (These only give about 2 weeks of relief)
- Epidural (these are very painful and last just 3 weeks) or
- Surgery on the plates which are trapping the nerves in her back (This is very serious surgey which could lead to paralysis)

I try to be supportive. My father is doing his best too, however I also have medical problems which I am finding difficult to come to terms with.
I am really worried about everything.
I don't want to talk to anyone as I am the type of person who bottles everything up and deals with one thing at a time, but this is really....","That cant be easy to deal with at all! especially because it is someone you care a lot about.

and in school im messed with cause if my weight, a few months ago a also was bulimic, and went from 224pnds to 178pnds, but i still think im fat cause of what people tell me....i dont know what to do 

one prob. is that i dont want my parents to find out, and if i go to a doc, he will tell them, and last time,i went to a doc and told them,and it was bad....

its been 2 weeks....im now depressed....i dont know what else to do....im not happy my skin is kinda yellow, im always weak....please tell me what i can do...anything...plz","Oh my goodness...you need professional help sweetie. There are a lot of people out here that would love to help you, but bulemia is way out of our scope of knowledge. You need a doctor regardless of whether he tells your parents or not. We're talking about your life here love, and I'm sure you don't want to die, do you? If you see a doctor, he can refer you to a councillor for your problems, and there is good anti-depressant medications out there, although that's not always the answer either. You should start by calling a kids help-line or something along those lines. Something anonymous where they don't even need to know your name. Then you need to find a doctor, then you need to find a good councillor.  You need to move rather quickly though, as it sounds like you're jaundiced (your yellowing skin), which means your liver is having trouble. Just take things one day at a time, or if you have to, one hour at a time. After you have something to eat, get out of the house immediately, go for a walk, put something else in your mind besides getting rid of the food.  Think about something that makes you happy, a pet, a person, whatever you need to think about. Life is wonderful sweetie, although it may not seem like it right now. It is, I promise. You can get through this, I know you can, but it has to start with YOU. YOU are the one that needs to start taking these steps. No one can do it for you. I wish I was there so I could hold your hand. I really do, I feel so bad for you. So, remember, take baby steps, but please, start taking them as soon as you can. Time is of the essence here. You can ask the doctor not to tell your parents, but why don't you tell them first. Tell them of the problems you are having. Tell them about your bulemia, then tell them you are very very unhappy, and that you need help. Haven't your parents noticed a difference in you? And as far as other people. They may mean well, but you have to stop listening to them. You need to listen to a professional. You have to start caring for yourself. Get a little selfish. Make YOU number one right now, as you need to. Every day that goes by, things inside your body and your head are getting a little bit worse. I really believe that your parents HAVE to know, as you need support. I really hope I helped you...I really do. I will be praying for you, and praying for you and praying for you. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE let me know how you are doing. Leave me a note, PLEASE! I'll do whatever I have to do to help you. But, like I said, I'll be praying for you in the mean time.

I want to also talk with people that have this and see how it affected them. ((I have never started my period..duh if you were all wandering why i'm takeing all these tests))","I had never heard of MRKH.  So I googled MRKH and first off found www.mrkh.org.  

The signs and symptoms sound exactly like what you have described.

You usually discover that you have no vagina during puberty. Although you develop breasts and pubic hair, you do not start having periods. This is because the ovaries will produce the female hormones that make normal development occur but the absence of the uterus and vagina means that there is no period. Most of you report this when you are 15 or 16 years old.
However, some of you may have difficulties with having sex as your first problem.

What tests will I have?
Your GP will normally ask some questions and then examine you. Sometimes GPs feel that this examination is best done at a hospital by a gynaecologist and may refer you for this. During the examination, the doctor may discover that you have been born without a vagina.
Further investigations include:
 A blood test to check your chromosomes in order to exclude any other genetic abnormalities
 an ultrasound scan to confirm the absence of a womb but the presence of ovaries
As girls with this condition also have a 40% chance of having renal (kidney) problems or abnormalities, and 15% have a single kidney, a scan or X-ray of this area may also be recommended.  

Tough.

37,2246260,Advanced Throat Cancer?,"Ok, so my dad is 55, and approx 4 months ago was diagnosed with cancer. He's advanced as if he were to do the surgery, it would remove his voice box and leave him with both a breathing tube and a permanent stomach peg.  The last time he had any treatment was 3 weeks ago (he is scheduled to commence proper radiation/chemo on the 5th of december).  I guess i'm asking whether or not it is likely he will be ok?  I know that after the treatment he will be in remission, but what is the likely outcome.  I need to prepare myself, and my family for the most likely outcome :(  I know that each situation is different, which is why i'm not relying on statistics, but its seems that everything I read, it is likely the patient may last a few years after the treatment, but the best they can do is slow the cancer down, rather than rid the cancer cells, and leave him in remission.

could this be a form of cancer?

--Side Effects--Bupropion
Side effects that you should report to your prescriber or health care professional as soon as possible:
Uncommon:
�blurred vision
�difficulty breathing or wheezing
�fast or irregular heartbeat (palpitations)
�increased blood pressure
�hallucinations
�redness, blistering, peeling or loosening of the skin, including inside the mouth
�unusual tiredness or weakness
More common:
�agitation, anxiety, or restlessness, especially in the first week of treatment or when doses are changed
�confusion
�seizures
�skin rash, itching, hives
�vomiting

---CONCERTA---
�  Do not take methylphenidate if you have taken a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor such as isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil), or tranylcypromine (Parnate) in the last 14 days. 
 �  Do not take methylphenidate without first talking to your doctor if you have 
      � an allergy to methylphenidate; 
      � severe tension, agitation, or anxiety; 
      � glaucoma; 
      � motor tics or have been diagnosed with Tourette's syndrome; 
      � depression; 
      � a psychotic condition such as schizophrenia; 
      � epilepsy or another seizure disorder; 
      � high blood pressure (hypertension); 
      � a history of alcohol or drug abuse; or 
      � a narrowing or blockage of your gastrointestinal tract (esophagus, stomach, or intestines). 

Is your brother taking bupropion for depression or another mental disorder? I found on a few web pages that state Concerta should not be taken if the patient has any type of depression or schizophrenia etc....

Also the the Tetracycline....

DRUG INTERACTIONS: It is recommended that tetracycline not be taken at the same time as aluminum-, magnesium-, or calcium- based antacids, such as Mylanta, Maalox, Tums, or Rolaids since, like food, these compounds bind tetracycline in the intestine. Similarly, tetracycline should not be taken with minerals (such as calcium or iron), with bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol) or with dairy products.

Tetracycline may enhance the activity of warfarin (Coumadin) and result in excessive ""thinning"" of the blood, necessitating a reduction in the dose of warfarin. Phenytoin (Dilantin), carbamazepine (Tegretol), and barbiturates (such as phenobarbital) can enhance the metabolism of tetracycline.

61,3428765,"For Parents Only, Please!! Does anyone have a child that has been diagnosed ADHD?","I thinking about taking my 7 yr old son to get tested for ADHD later this month. Last week I took my nieces to get shot and up on the wall was a list of symptoms for ADHD. And right away I thought of my son. Is it curable or just treatable? What things do they do at the evaluation? And what symptoms did your child have? My sons daydreams alot, he forgets when I just give him 1 task, he cant think on his homework, he gets angry and fustrated very easily. I thought all these things were pretty much common being a kid. To me I feel like he is hard on himself and i try everything to help him not to worry or be fustrated.I want to help him, but what should I do? What has worked for you and your child?","my son was diagnosed with adhd when he was in kindergarten.  I knew there was something wrong long before that but the Dr told me to wait until he was a little older. He also has been diagnosed with emotional disorder (bipolar) He was classified as having severe ADHD.  One thing I noticed right away was how hyper he was all the time. He couldn't handle any sort of stress. He would become irate if his routine changed even the littlest. He couldn't play with a group of children very long without becoming agitated or aggressive.  He couldn't follow simple tasks without being side tracked. He has his own space (which was big) and if it was invaded he would become aggressive and very upset.  He would become upset because he couldn't do the simple things other children around him were doing.  I spent several nights trying to help him learn his ABC's which would end in a huge crying session and him hitting himself.  In my case, my ex husband became the focus of some of his anger. He refuses to see him or talk to him because my ex would tease him about his problem.

My son's psychologist said that in some cases they can grow out of it.  (She has been a life saver and a big help in dealing with schools) In cases like my son where it is so severe and accompanied by a mental illness they will have to learn to live with it. It is easier to help them learn to live with it when it is caught young.

It is also a family issue.  Everyone will need to learn how to adjust and deal with the child.  They are not on the same wavelength as everyone else.  I've learned this over the last two years.  I have to deal with my daughter one way and my son another.

If your son is diganosed with ADHD, READ everything you can on it. Also, don't get just one oppionion. Try and get two.  They will give you and the school a test to fill out. Another thing is learn the law!!! It will come in handy.  I had to force a school to test my son so he could get an IEP. Even then you will have issues with the school.  Most schools are not equipped to deal with children like this and most educators don't have the patience or time to deal with them. 

I've been dealing with this for awhile.  I had to do alot of readjusting to help my son deal with this. The best thing for your child is to be involved and show them that no matter what you love them.",,,,,,,,,To me I feel like he is hard on himself and i try everything to help him not to worry or be fustrated.I,ADHD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Yes: I want to help him, but what should I do?",,,,,Yes:  The best thing for your child is to be involved and show them that no matter what you lo,,,ADHD

WHAT to eat for losing weight

 Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, especially NC (negative calorie) food.

* Print these lists. They will be your ... ""Bible"", from now on !
* Dill and parsely - include them in all your salads. Also ognion + garlic.
* Try eat mostly fresh vegs & fruits (whenever possible, of course)
* If you really want a book, then check this out: The Negative Calorie Diet Workbook & Cookbook - eBook (Win95/98 only). Read more about this e-book here.


 Eat fish, chicken, beef, pork. (preferences are in this order)

* If you are a vegetarian, then ignore this!
* Avoid fat meat


 Eat 2-3 slices of bread/day. Don't EVER exclude bread from your diet!

 Snacks between meals (if needed): apples, oranges, grepfruits and other NC fruits

* Don't cheat ... NO cookies, chips, candies, brownies etc! 
* EVEN if they have ""low fat"" indication... They might have low fat, yet they can have lots of CALORIES !!!


 About rice, potatoes, beans, [xxx]nuts, pastry, pasta... you know!

* Don't eat too much of those, at least during the first weeks of the diet. I'm not a low carb addict, but I've noticed weight gains if consuming those in large quantities, especially when associated with other foods.
* If you like them a lot, try and eat them like one meal. A nice delicious plate of spaghetti could be your lunch (never dinner!), followed by a nice big apple. These rich starch foods are not good for dinner!
* At dinner time, chose mainly large mixed veggies salads... with fish, lean meat or cheese (if you are not a vegetarian). 

if u want to lose weight the best food to it are baked potatoes with nothing on it. no salt no nothing just plain. u can eat a 10000000000 baked potatoes till ur stuff and not gain a pound. i heard that from a weight loss tape. the best drink is water or gatorade. thats a start then when you work out do some taeboo. if u want a macine. run with dumbells on a treadmill. u could do the rocky workout. but thats a new story. u could use a butterfly macine i think it works the abs

1) It is not just the amount you eat, but what you eat. Lean meats and vegtables that snap are a good place to start. And by snap I mean fresh and not boiled or doused with better or whatever.

2) Exercise moderatly but for about an hour every other day. Spend half of that walking or running at a good enough pace for you to feel labored. The other half of the time use weights, or exercises such as push ups or situps to get a muscle ""burn"". A gym is also an option, but I don't know if you have the money for or want to spend the money on it.

3) Sleep well. To bed earlier and up earlier. Exercise in the morning when you wake up, not in the evening before bed. 7 hours of GOOD sleep is a must.

4) Occupy yourself with a hobby that keeps your attention for a long period of time. A hobby like this keeps your mind focused and gives less of a chance for snacking from boredom.

That is a good place to start... if you see good results, keep it up and modify to fit you... if it does not, see a doctor AND a trainer 

Keep working out, drink water a lot, eat 5 to 6 meals a day but in small quantities, vegtables are important specially cucumber and lattice, fruits not be eaten after meals except by 2 to 3 hours, minimize the starch quantities in your meals lots of salad is important, your last meal must be before you sleep by 2 to 3 hours
the most important thing is you don't lose patient wait and have a strong will to be as what you want

you might have some more ideas from www.ivillage.com

In fact my husband has 2 children from previous marriage and although I love my stepchildren as they are my own it's not the same. I feel the same way, seeing all these crackheads and pedophiles having children that are not wanted or abused and I literally have a breakdown when I hear of an abandoned baby or a baby killed and thrown in the garbage, but the best way that I look at it is (and I'm not a very religious person) when God is ready He will let me have one. Have you ever considered adoption. There are thousands if not millions of unwanted children that need a mommy and daddy. Why not fulfill your dreams as well as one of those unwanted children's dreams. I would have but my past felony conviction from so many years ago won't allow it.","pregnancy, miscarriages",,,,i am sick of people telling me its because i am too anxious i have done all the test that they can do,"pregnancy, miscarriages",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,why cant i have a baby ?,,,,,"Yes: Honey, I can't explain it either.

31,1437242,Pregnancy and mood-swings?,"My family don't believe that pregnant women get mood-swings and get overemotional. Well they kind of do but they think that at 2 months pregnant it's 'too soon for that kind of thing' and I'm just attention-seeking.

I thought, maybe they're right so I tried really hard to 'snap out of it' and 'control myself' but it didn't help and I really, really tried hard. I keep bursting into tears for no reason and I don't even know why I'm crying. I'm phobic about childbirth and I'm really worried why I don't feel any affection towards the unborn baby yet.

It doesn't seem real yet. I don't even have a bump yet. all I have is painful, swollen breasts, abdominal cramps and depression. I keep having scary dreams about the baby being born dead, or having a miscarriage or it being deformed or it being born and then dying of cot-death or of it being born perfect but I'm such a bad mother that I don't know how to look after it and it dies.

I don't know what to do.",Every thing that you are feeling is normal.  It's almost as soon as you find out that your pregnant the worrying starts.  All most everyone experiences some level of these feelings. Your emotions are very different when your pregnant and everyone deals with them differently.  Not knowing what life is going to be like with a newborn and not knowing what the delivery is going to be like is also very scary.  I would get as much information as you can about delivery and baby development in the uterus as well as talking to your Dr about all the feelings you are feeling.  You may be at risk of postpartum depression (which is also very normal).  As for it not feeling real that's OK..pretty soon you will hear the babies heart beat and then see and ultrasound and start feeling the baby move..for me that's when it started to feel real.

46,225134,"I have mood swings throughout the day, and I can actually feel myself going in and out of them?","I'll be extremely happy, then later, I'll shift into sad mode.  I get feelings of peace, feel loved, feel successful.  Then later I feel hopeless, unloved, neglected.  I have been diagnosed as having depression and anxiety disorder by my nurse practioner.  I don't trust her judgement because she prescribed medication without really giving any kind of diagnostic test.  I was prescribed Lexapro and Niravam.  The Lexapro didn't seem to help much, made me sick, and made me gain weight.  I just stopped taking it.  It's been so bad at times, I wanted to check myself into the hospital because I felt like I wanted to die.  I don't know what to do.  I feel like no one, not even the nurse or doctors, ever takes me seriously.  I am extremely depressed right now.  Yesterday I was really bad and isolated myself from my fiance and my family.","I agree with not trusting the fact that you were given meds without a diagnostic process of any kind. However, there are a few things that can contribute to mood swings. The most obvious is bipolar disorder (aka manic depression), and there's also menopause (I don't know your age or sex), diet, and just clinical depression which can manifest in many different ways - some people can even have hallucinations with profound depression. 

I suggest that you change doctors and explain all of this to the new doctor. Tell him that you are looking for a doctor that will actually examine and test your symptoms. Let him know what meds you have tried and all the effects they have had. 

You do need to realize that many mental health medications have side effects like the ones you mentioned. You may be able to find one that has fewer effects, but never stop taking a med until you have called your doc and notified him of the problem. These kind of meds need to be kept at an even level in your system, and it can cause more harm than good to take them sporadically or to stop suddenly.

It is a good idea to keep a journal - keep track of your moods - list the feeling, the strength of the feeling, the cause of the feeling (if there is one), the time you began feeling this way, etc. Take this journal with you when you see the doctor.",mood swings,,,,I am extremely depressed right now.,depressed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I don't trust her judgement because she prescribed medication without really giving any kind of diagnostic test.,medication,,,,,,"I have mood swings throughout the day, and I can actually feel myself going in and out of them?",,,,,Yes: I agree with not trusting the fact that you were given meds without a diagnostic process of any kind. ,,,

I suggest starting with an endocrinologist.  If you have a hormone or thyroid problem it is easy enough to fix.  Incompetent cervix could be another cause and easily fixed.  I had 6 miscarriges before I had my son and it ended up being due to low estrogin levels easily fixed with supplements.

You you will go through an a xray to check if it's your spine that's causing the pain. If it's the muscle, go to a physical therapist.

I would definitely request a second ultrasound so that you can see for certain what is going on. It helps to know. 

It has been speculated that nearly half of pregnancies end in miscarriage. There are many reasons that it happens, but in most cases it's just something isn't developing correctly.

She was like a sister to me, and now I'll never get to see her again, why couldn't she just tell me, i feel so guilty about the things i said to her, how can i feel better about it? i just wish i could say sorry...","first of all, your friend was trying to protect you.  When things go wrong like that we as humans always seem to hurt the ones we love and those closest to us. maybe she was trying to safe you the pain and anguish of having to watch her die.and I am sure she was scared, both of dying and of how you might react.  It is always hard when a life ends with unfinished busines like this. I am sure if you knew the facts, then you would not have said these things to her, but i am sure she will forgive you.  WHen you went to the hospital did you tell her you did not mean what was said, as I am sure she appologised as well.  Only thing that can help is yourself, you have to accept that this was not under normal circumstances that this happened, and your friend did start by saying hurtful things to you.  People deal with things differently in life and this was her way off dealing with things.

Best advice I can give is for you to give it time, and if time is not the answer then find someone who you can talk to, a friend, doctor or a councilor.  Try going to her grave and talk to her tell her you are sorry.  Perhaps you can raise funds in her name for the cancer unit at the local hospital as away of easing the burden.

Any ideas appreciated :)","""I'm very happy in life at the moment.""

I think you may be experiencing something my cousin goes through. When her life is running smoothly; no confusion, no heartaches, no financial issues etc.. She will always find something to obsess about. She once said to me; ""I think I am freaking out because there is nothing wrong with my life now and it is like I am waiting for something to happen. Life can't be this good for long!"" It is like she is waiting for something to foul up the comfort zone she has found herself in. She will ""look"" for something to be worried about. ""I should not have bought that coat!"" ""This is the worst haircut I have ever had!"" So on and so on. Maybe you find yourself in a place in life where all is well and yet you really don't think you ""deserve"" it to be. I believe a lot of people feel this way at some point in life to a certain degree.

Maybe you never really wanted the ink and now your subconscious is playing on your mind. However;  there could be much more going on. Maybe a visit to the Doc is not a bad idea. You do NOT need to be ashamed of seeking help. People care, even those in your life you may think really don't. They will all understand if you see someone. Don't let shame keep you from the help you might need.",anxiety issues,,,,"I'm freaking out and having panic attacks that I can't just ""take it off"" there and then and that its there for years unless I pay to get it removed.",panic attacks,,,Maybe I'm freaking out because I'm stuck with the tat for now and its up to me to calm myself down.,tattoo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Could I be misplacing my anxiety about other things onto the tattoo?,,,,,Yes: Don't let shame keep you from the help you might need.,,,

And humans make errors.  It is a known fact that the average delay in diagnosis of Endometriosis is 9 long years and takes over 5 physicians before a woman is given an answer to her pain.  Years of suffering in silence and being told it is in her head is a matter of course for most women and girls with Endo.  Therefore, you really need to be an empowered patient and educate yourself so that you can make the best choices for your case based on factual, timely information.  

It is wonderful to have a caring doctor in whom you have placed your trust, but doctors are not God and it is a known fact that there exists a disproportionate amount of erroneous info among many docs concerning this disease.  Just because someone is nice or means well, doesn't mean they can effectively treat the disease.

That said, there is an abundance of evidence-based and current info available in lay terms at www.endocenter.org.  You may wish to also speak with others by joining this support group at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/erc.

There is no definitive cure for Endometriosis, and a lot of the treatments are only temporarily, if it all, effective (and most come with side effects).  Your best bet is to find a surgeon who truly understands and treats only Endometriosis; surgical removal such as through excision can often afford an extremely high success rate for long-term relief and resolve of symptoms (versus medical therapy or superficial surgery like ablation, vaporization and other similar methods).  See www.centerforendo.com for more info on that.

You do not have to suffer.  While there is no cure, there are ways in which you can live well despite the disease.  Take an active role in your healthcare and you will do well.  Get the new book, ""Living Well with Endometriosis..."" by Kerry Ann Morris (available at all bookstores and Amazon.com).  It is highly regarded in the Endo community and applauded by many healthcare professionals.

That's why they can be so darn scary. But it's better to go to the hospital just to be sure. They would rather see you there with a panic attack than to have you second-guess and be wrong. Are you male or female? Often doctors don't take female symptoms as seriously because they think only men get heart disease. If you wake up in the middle of the night trying to catch your breath, you may have sleep apnea. That's when you stop breathing for several seconds and up to a minute. This can cause heart problems. So talk to your doctor about testing at a sleep clinic. (Do you snore?? That often accompanies sleep apnea.) I know it's frustrating to go to the doctor so often and to find nothing wrong. To learn more about panic attacks, go to the link below. You can also do a search on sleep apnea. If you think it could be panic attacks, there are medications you can take to control them... the SSRI class of medications. Talk to your doctor, or better, to a psychiatrist. That's a medical doctor with special training in emotional issues. They can diagnose conditions and prescribe appropriate medications. Good luck.

It's much healthier to commit to a support group. I'm sure there are hotlines you can call for the nearest group that meets in your area.  Check those out.  

You may want to include some form of physical activity into your daily schedule, even if some days you will not carry them out.  Reward yourself when you do with something you like.

Think of some of your positive qualities.  Write them down and stick them in places you can see to read back to yourself, then run them thruough your mind a few times a day, even if you dont feel like it.  You need reprogramming while depressing.

Be selective about tv, stay away from news and others (eg, comedy sitcoms, talk shows, spy movies, ....), music, and be aware of other environmental noise elements so you can either avoid them or else minimise the effects.  Just as well, the Internet is not always so wholesome to be in (info overload).  Whatever it is, you need to examine your immediate environment and remove/minimise anything that bothers you a lot.  

When you find yourself analysing stuff too much, find something else to do.  Change the way you walk home from work/school, take a dif route, even if it's longer.  You need to get out from the routine of doing things.  Modify your diet a little.  

These are just some ways you may reduce the effects of outward routine, so your mind may find dif channels to park in.  Nothing ever changes overnight.  Be patient with yourself and with others.  Laugh a little, cartoons are great for that.

It was horrible to be tortured everyday, and to make matters worse I was very shy and I was afraid to tell my mom, so the bullying just got worse until I broke down at home one day and my mom finally went to the school to put a stop to it. NOW my son is going through this and he is in the 3rd grade. I just cant even stand this. I have gone to the teachers and they say that he is fine and no one messes with him. Well teachers dont always see everything that goes on. Same thing in my case. The teachers never always saw what was going on. He has Aspergers Syndrome which is a high functioning autism, so Im sure he is an easier target for them. What advice can I give him. I just dont know what to say to him exactly.","If you went to the teachers and nothing was done, you need to go straight to the principal.  A lot of teachers may resent the idea that they have to ""raise"" children, because it's their job only to educate, so they may be ignoring problems, or training themselves to overlook them because it's easier.  Your son deserves to get an education within a safe environment.  Adults would get ""charged"" with creating a hostile work environment, so it should be no different.  If nothing changes, go to the school board.  Raise heck!! And don't stop until it changes.

Bullies *are* insecure with themselves, but sometimes it's hard to stand up for yourself when you feel cornered by everyone.  I was always told to ignore it, but it never stopped them from following me down the hall until the bell rang.  The only thing that would help is for your son to be confident and assertive with his replies, which is hard when you're shy and in that situation to begin with.  But at some point, he's got to learn to stand up for himself, or else it will last through high school.",Aspergers,,,,It was horrible to be tortured everyday,bullied,,,I was very shy and I was afraid to tell my mom,bullied,I just cant even stand this.,NOW my son is going through this (being bullied),,,,,so Im sure he is an easier target for them,Aspergers Syndrome,,,,,Well teachers dont always see everything that goes on. / The teachers never always saw what was going on.,Same thing in my case.,,,What advice can I give him.

9,3491116,My little boy ---?,"I tok him to the emergency room last night with a high fever and an awful smell coming from his nose.  In the E.R. the doc said he had a double ear infection and a sinus infection.  But the problem here is that I can see something in his nose that he did not put there.  When the doc went to use the light to look, mt little boy fought us and the doc hit what was in there.  It busted and blood came out.  THe smell was even worse but the doc was not concerned.  I am moma and this greatly concerns me.  Any one ever seen anything like this before?  I am taking him to his pediatricain on saturday to allow the anibiotics and the decongestant to work so that maybe she can see what is there in his nose.","Well, I am not a Dr, so I cannot give you ""medical advice"".

I am just a microbiology technician, in Australia.

I would say: ""Be reassured (a bit) by the way the Dr did not worry much about the goo that came out, when he hit the right spot.""

I suppose the Dr burst an abscess.  These are full of pus; blood and white blood cells.  They often stink badly, due to containing anaerobic bacteria, and their waste products.

Many places in and on our bodies are normally inhabited by anaerobic bacteria, and they can be fine, if they stay in the right place.  If they get into bad places, they can lead to abscesses forming, but these burst, and then all is OK ... eventually.

Occasionally, we need help from antibiotics, to get rid of these bacteria from places they should not live in.

Now, you say your son had a sinus infection?  It is possible that the abscess formed near a face sinus  Maybe it will clear up, now it has popped.  If he seems to get worse, take him back to a Dr, and tell the whole story; to put that Dr ""in the picture"".",,,Female,,,,,,THe smell was even worse but the doc was not concerned.

Try to keep the answers positive, Do Not include things like: Sex, drugs, alcohol, cussing, or sleep. I am aware that I choose how I wish to feel and have had extensive Psych therapy, have even taken group therapy, still I end up throwing a fit. I do wish to get past this. I consider myself a very good hearted person , I really do love life- its just my temper flares real quick , but burns out fast too. Some people are really good at pressing my buttons. People who are extremly selfish, inconsiderate and narrow minded. Yes, I am married to him. He has good qualities too-I do love him-we all have our bad sides. I digress. Need to control my anger. Help. Thanks for your time.","Working on your anger issue is really hard. The best way I can advise to deal with it is to just simply walk away or if it is mostly your spouse, maybe counseling for both of you is in order. My husband used to really push my buttons. Once he ""thinks"" he is no longer getting a reaction, it should mellow out. I have been with my spouse for almost 20 years and it took me a long time to figure that out. I decided when I was 33 (I am now 41)that I was not going to live like that anymore. Most of the time my ""buttons get pushed"" is when he has had a few drinks and starts to be a complete idiot. My spouse is also selfish, inconsiderate and so narrowminded he refuses to try to educate himself on certain issues. That is his choice and if you think you can change someone else, you know that won't happen. Change comes from within and it looks like you are trying for that goal. Asking others is fine, but going into depth requires a good friend that is near you every day and has the patience to listen and not give the advice for you to leave your spouse. GOOD LUCK. 

PS. I do not believe in venting to others on the internet as I have seen it make people dwell and hold anger. The people that I know that have done that get more angry, more often. Yes, you could have an allie, but that allie could be in worse shape than you and will hold you back from advancing your progress. Once they stopped and spoke w/ true friends and layed off the IM ing and other avenues on the net, they did calm down and make a lot of progress.",good ways to deal with anger,,Female,,,,"I consider myself a very good hearted person , I really do love life /  Yes, I am married to him.

I don't know if you've ever tried meditation or anything spiritual, but if you are open-minded, you can find a LOT of books that can help you, as well as self-help support groups which can give you some input (you'll need to contact some counseling service or look in the phone book to find them).  
If your situation gets really bad, you may need to go to the emergency room at your local hospital (if you're contemplating some drastic action, they HAVE to help you); just take the insurance that you had from where you used to live.

It has now left me angry and confused because i was in a n e during my last miscarriage they know im 0- and they did not give me the injection that is needed to prevent this happening again......why i dont understand.  Its now left me emotiional because it says the injection is needed within 72 hours of miscarriage.  Why didnt the doctor tell me about this and why is  there no concern  ...I dont know who to seek advise from because my gp doesnt seem concerned about me miscarrying but it is beginning to leave me really depressed because me and my partner so much want to be proud parents x,"As previous respondents have indicated, blood grouping is not a cause for miscarriage - this is often confused with the issue of rhesus incompatibility. My advice would be to request a review at the recurrent miscarriage clinic - district generals with maternity services have these.

37,3836635,Treating ADD/ADHD without stimulants possible?,"My name is Brian and I�m 18 years old. I was diagnosed with ADHD about five years ago. I was placed on ritalin to treat my hyper-activity that was causing problems in school. The doctor changed my medicines for whatever reason I cannot remember to a drug known as 
Adderall XR� � with that in mind, not once do I recall myself being dependant upon ritalin but ever since the changing in medicines, I feel like life has come to a stop. I usually take 3 times the dosages prescribed by my doctor and I am fully aware that I will be out of pills until the next refill. I can�t seem to swing away from this! I KNOW I have an addiction problem, I can�t force myself to tell the truth in the doctor�s office. Adderall is also known as an AMPHETAMINE so for those of you wondering why it�s this addictive, it falls right underneath meth addictions. I just want to life a normal life, how do I win this battle by starting when I�m sober? ...","Hi Brian,

My name is Sarah and I have a degree in psychology, keep in mind that I am not a doctor however.  

Anyway, I think what you are going through is very common.  The first question that I'm wondering is why your doctor switched your medication?  I know that you said that you cannot remember but it might help you to ask.  Also, it's good that you know that taking that amount of pills is not a good idea.  Have you told anyone else about this?  A friend or family member?  My advice would be to tell someone (or just let them read your post) and have them go to the doctor with you on your next appointment and that way the truth will come out.  You should really let someone know about this before it's too late.  

As far as battling your ADHD, I do not think that medication alone works in most cases.  You should also seek counseling.  The two coupled together have a very high success rate as opposed to one in absence of the other.  It's just like depression, you can treat it with medication but there is still an underlying problem that contributes to it and until that problem is solved it will continue to come back.  

You seem to have a good head on your shoulders and I hope that you will seek help in others that are close to you.  Good luck. :)",ADD/ADHD,18-24 years old,,,I feel like life has come to a stop.,changing in medicines,,,"I KNOW I have an addiction problem, I can�t force myself to tell the truth in the doctor�s office. / I just want to life a normal life, how do I win this battle by starting when I�m sober? ...",addiction problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I just want to life a normal life, how do I win this battle by starting when I�m sober? ...",,,,,"Yes: My name is Sarah and I have a degree in psychology, keep in mind that I am not a doctor however.  / I think what you are going through is very common. / My advice would be to tell someone  / You seem to have a good head on your shoulders and I hope that you will seek help in others that are close to you.

Why?  Because this has very little to do with chemicals, it has everything to do with her coping skills.  It is one of psychology's biggest mysteries about how the brain function works.  When you become depressed for example, you begin to create a nerve dysfunction in the brain actually perpetuating the problem.  The symptons cause the probelm if that makes sense.  My point is that if she has never had coping skills, her thinking is always irrational and will cause the problems in her brain.  That's why without learning how to ""cope"" she's not gonna be healthy.  Her biggest issue is that without someone, she will die.  A lot of peole fear this.  It's usually caused by neglect and/or abandonment as a child.  And as an adult, they can not comprehend that they will not die without someone there.

56,401725,"Low progesterone level and consecutive miscarriages,trying to conceive again?","Hi, We have been trying for a baby for 2 years.
I was conceived for 3 times and had early miscarriages.
 I dont have inferitility problem,bec., i already have one son and also had miscarriages.
My gyno said my progesterone level is low, and told me to start the medication once i conceive.But its been 4 months after i had my last miscarriage.Its really awfull, but i consoled myself, bec., i dont want the stress to stop me getting pregnant.
Can anybody suggest any way to get me pregnant? Or to increase the progesterone level?","This progesterone level in itself is only a little bit below the optimum for a peak progesterone level. I wonder if there isn't some other reason suggesting low progesterone (or luteal phase insufficiency) such as a short cycle or premenstrual spotting that is pushing your physician in the direction of prescribing Clomid. Without knowing more about your situation, it is hard to know if this is the best intervention for you at this time.

Have you been identifying the peak mucus day for several months, and having intercourse on that day for at least six months? What is the quality of your cervical mucus? Did you have an infection since the birth of your last child that might have caused a tubal blockage or uterine inflammation? Have your thyroid levels been checked? Have you had an ultrasound that might show a polyp or fibroids? Has your husband had a semenalysis? 

With two prior pregnancies, it might be a little soon do a laparoscopy to check for endometriosis or other problems but if infertility persists that might be in order.

Clomid is a legitimate therapy in the medical literature for luteal phase insufficiency as well as lack of ovulation. But it can also cause poor mucus and a thin endometrial lining in some people. A more thorough workup of the luteal phase (the time in the cycle after ovulation) might be helpful in determining the best therapy. At Pope Paul VI Institute, the type of workup for this problem might include THREE determinations of progesterone AND estrogen five, seven and nine days after ovulation (as determined by ovulation predictor kits or peak day in charting). Estrogen levels should be in the range of 110 or 120(or 11 or12 depending on the lab). Progesterone should be at least 12 on peak plus five days, 15 on peak plus 7, and 12 on peak plus nine.

Sometimes progesterone will drop off rapidly nine days after ovulation even though values to that point are optimal. We diagnose a late luteal phase insufficency if the progesterone nine days after the peak drops 50% below the value seven days after the peak. If only one progesterone determination is made,you will not be able to diagnose a luteal phase insufficiency. If you have good mucus and estrogen, there are no other problems, and only progesterone is deficient, my feeling is progesterone vaginal capsules in a 600 mg. dose may be a better therapy. These are available by prescription from Kubat pharmacy in Omaha, Nebraska.

If both estrogen and progesterone are deficient AND you are ovulating, the method most often used at Pope Paul VI is very low dose Clomid (25 mg. day three, four and five of the cycle) followed by HCG injections (2000 units every other day for four doses starting three days after the peak). This is a more complicated therapy, but the low dose of Clomid given earlier in the cycle has less adverse effect on the mucus than standard regimens and is very effective if you are already ovulating and have luteal phase insufficiency of both progesterone and estrogen.",miscarriages,,Female,,"Its really awfull, but i consoled myself, bec., i dont want the stress to stop me getting pregnant.",miscarriages,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Can anybody suggest any way to get me pregnant?,Can anybody suggest any way to get me pregnant?,,,Can anybody suggest any way to get me pregnant?,,Yes: (All examples shared in the response),,,

85,2964508,"why is my 3.5 year old giving me so problems with eating lately, and why the sudden temper tantrums?","she has recently been giving me a really hard time when it comes to eating. normally, she eats A LOT! it used to blow me away at the amount of food she could consume in a day, now i'm lucky if i get 1 meal a day in her. i know kids will eat when they are hungry, but it seems that she just isn't hungry. this has been an issue for the last 2 weeks. also, she has NEVER thrown a tantrum, until last night. she threw such a fit, and got so upset, and screamed so much, that she made herself cough until she threw up...3 times! what's the deal here?","Wow. The first thing I would check is her interaction with people over the past couple weeks. Is she in Daycare? Does she have a play pal she's spending a lot of time with? Does she have a caregiver at home if you work outside the home?

Sometimes kids at that age have observed another person behaving in a particular way in order to obtain the desired result 
(ie. a tantrum that gets a child an ice cream or toy they want). She might be trying out this new negotiation technique.

Another thing about 3 1/2, they are learning a zillion new things each day and their little heads are full, full, full. Imagine if you worked in an office and you had 20 projects you needed to complete and your boss came in and dumped a huge stack of stuff in your inbox and said, "" I need this ASAP"". You might grumble after the boss leaves, but a three year old faced with a proportionally simliar moment will fling themselevs onto the floor and scream and cry until all the bad stuff goes away.

Try simplifying her schedule for a couple of days and try going on a food field trip to the grocery store. Take your time and show her all the pretty produce and things she might like and get a cheap little notebook to carry around to write down the list of all the things she likes. Then when you do your shopping, you can get a few things off her favorite list each time so she has some say in what goes into her tummy. You could go through magazines and cut out pictures of food or use the google image option and make her a ""Menu"" like she's got her own restaurant. You can split it up in pages of breakfast, lunch and dinner and special snacks. She can go through the picture book and select what she will eat and then you can show her how to spell that word and maybe how to make the food item (like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich)

Both of my kids went through the ridiculously picky eater stage about that age. They will survive! My son is 6'2"" and a college rower and my daughter is 5'10"" and a volleyball player and coach.  The month my son would only eat cubes of baked potatoes, Stouffer's spinach souffle, pizza, Cheerios, PBJ's and hot dogs I thought I was gonna lose it! She will move through it.

Temper tantrum solution: This is weird but IT WORKS. When kids are out of control, it scares them as much as it scares you.
Get an ice cold cup of water and very calmly tell her to take a sip and calm down. If she won;t, tell her she can drink it or wear it. If she continues to flail and scream ( and I know this sounds bizzare) toss the water right in her face. She will come to a complete stop and you will have her full attention.

Go and get another cup of ice cold water and ask her if she is now ready to have a sip of water. She will drink it- trust me. And the cold and sipping motion will calm her down enough to regain control of her self.

I only had to do this ONE TIME with my kids. Any time I saw a tantrum coming from then on, I would ask them if they needed a glass of water and they would calm down and even go get themselves a cup.

Firstly let me say how sorry I am for your losses. My husband and I have had two miscarriages in the last year and so totally sympathise with how you are feeling.

The advice your friend has given you is completely incorrect. You blood never mixes with the baby's so there is no chance of this kind of reaction occuring. NHS policy usually waits for three miscarriages until the doctor recommends some kind of investigation be done. You are free to chose your own GP and I would recommend that you find a new one!

Very often we don't know why miscarriages take place, and although I know this is of no comfort to you, please at least be assured that it is nothing that you have done that has caused this.

The miscarriage association as a confidential help line which you can call if you need to talk to someone. You can also ring NHS Direct and speak to a nurse there.

I would also look in to adopting. I know many couples who have had problems either concieving or carring a child to term. They have adopted and then have concieved naturally! By adopting you may allow a child that would have been aborted the chance of life.

You and your partner will remain in our prayers (if that is ok).",miscarriages,,Female,,This has left me devastated and left me looking for the reason why this keeps happening. / Its now left me emotiional /  it is beginning to leave me really depressed,miscarriages / they did not give me the injection / miscarriages,,,,,It has now left me angry / Why didnt the doctor tell me about this and why is  there no concern,they know im 0- and they did not give me the injection,,,,,,,,,confused,they know im 0- and they did not give me the injection,,,,,I dont know who to seek advise from,i recently had my 3rd miscarriage.,,,I dont know who to seek advise from,,"Yes: Firstly let me say how sorry I am for your losses.

18,1937227,Help! BV or Yeast infection???,I've had this reocurring yeast infection or bv infection it seems to come after every second period i've tried switching tampons didn't work. I've been with the same sex partner for 7 years and were both very clean. i've tried canestine it helped the symptoms but took a while to go away but keeps comming back.. the discharge is a pinkish colour sometimes just white and thick it doesent have a fishy odour but sometimes it does smell weird its very itchy sometimes its not and it burns  its very irritating..I've been tested for everything i told the doctor about it my last pap test and nothing showed up and i would like to figure this out its been years and i would like to have a normal sex life :( please help if you know the answer!,"First of all I feel your pain, I used to have constant bacterial vaginosis and yeast infections during my teens however when I switched from commercial tampons and commercial pads to a silicone menstrual cup my infections stopped  from constant infections for 7 years to not a single infection in 3-4 years now. I looked into it more, also into more general menstrual and vaginal information to find out why this was a problem for me, and now I'm a menstrual activist and study gynaecology.


During menstruation you of course release menstrual blood into your vagina, this menstrual blood is a different pH to that of the naturally acidic environment of the vagina and as such the differing pH can affect the normal vaginal flora  thus also why you should not use anything but plain water to wash with, any sort of chemicals can interfere with that pH and lead to infections. The risk of infection during menstruation alone is not common unless you already have an imbalance in your vaginal pH, the change in pH from menstrual blood furthers the problem and menstrual blood is nutritious so bacteria love the stuff. 


Stop using tampons is my immediate thought, particularly commercial tampons such as Tampax, are the most harmful of all menstrual options, they prevent your vagina from cleaning itself, give bacteria a place to multiply, leave fibres within the vagina, put chemicals into the vagina that affect vaginal pH so in turn affect vaginal flora, dry out mucosa leading to vaginal splitting, and various other problems are caused from tampon use. This is why tampons are so strongly linked with vaginal infections and toxic shock syndrome, as well as other vaginal and menstrual health problems.

If you prefer internal menstrual options to external menstrual options such as pads or free-flow then I would highly suggest using a menstrual cup, these are cups that are either bell-shaped or diaphragm-shaped and made from medical grade silicone, rubber or plastic depending on the brand. Menstrual cups have no health risks associated what-so-ever and unlike tampons they are also hygienic, they can be left in safely for up to 12 hours without leaking or risk, they can be worn at night, worn while swimming, worn before your period is due and some even worn during penetrative sex. Menstrual cups are also cheaper, more environmentally friendly and more body positive than tampons, as well as most brand offering money back guarantees if you do not like them, very few women send their menstrual cups back.

If you would prefer to stay with tampons then I would advise you use safer options such as organic tampons, sponge tampons or homemade tampons, this is because unlike commercial tampons these are all made from natural materials so less likely to cause the sort of vaginal splitting you see from commercial tampons also these materials are less absorbent so minimise risks, unlike commercial tampons these other tampon options do not contain unnecessary chemicals.

I'm 34, my oldest child is 15 months, and I'm suffering a bit with a flabby tummy after 2 kids in 3 years :)

I eat pretty healthily - when I tried to count calories, I'm not exceeding 1500 cals/day. I eat vegetables with meals, don't snack, do have a sweet tooth, but don't indulge it that often!

I am however 13 stone or so, and only 5'0. This puts me in the clinically obese category. 

I was born with club foot (both feet). Have had 8 operations on one ankle and 3 on the other. It's left me with chronic osteoarthritis in my ankles, which means walking etc etc very painful, and I'm on disability as a result. Swimming would be great, but with 2 kids and a husband who works odd shifts, it's not possible to get to a pool. 

A variation on Atkins' carb counting worked for a while - I lost about a stone, then the weight loss just stopped. Slimming World & Weightwatchers (despite sticking very carefully to them) didn't work at all. Any other ideas to help me lose weight?",I cant stand fools who don't read everything through and always discount medical reasons.

Never the less, i have to say something else, i know that the initial diagnosis is devastating, but you have to know that there is always hope and leukemia is one of the cancers with the highest cure rate so.. go to the doctor, take your chemo and pray a lot.. im sure you will be fine.

59,1042442,"Adoption of sibling, OMG tantrums, Please help?","We are in process of transitioning 3 year old sibling to our previously adopted twins who are almost 5. This poor litlle guy has had major trauma with being removed from his home and placement. The biggest concern we have is when he gets really mad he will throw his head against objects or the floor. One time he picked up a little childrens chair and threw it and screamed. I told him I would not listen to him do that and when he was done to please pick up the chair and put it back. I walked away and a couple of minutes later when he was quiet, I saw that he HAD in fact put the chair back and said sorry. I asked if he was feeling better, he said yes and we hugged it out and I told him that the behaviour is not aceptable and I don't want him to keep hurting himself. He has major speech and language delays. Any advice on how to help a child that hurts himself? We predict this scenerio when leaving a fun activity/place as well. Any coping techniques? Not hitting, please. Transition help?","Wow! This poor little guy has gone through a lot of changes! What a good person you are for doing your best to support him! Temper tantrums are caused by children who are not getting their needs met. If they are not throwing a tantrum because they are sick, hungry, or tired, they will throw a tantrum because it feels powerful, they get attention for it, they are testing limits, or they are simply feeling frustrated. I think youy son is just feeling pretty powerless right now.

Avoid punishing or threatening. When he throws a tantrum, do the unexpected. Either walk away or move him to a quiet place (his room, the couch) and say �When you are ready to calm down then you can come back.� Say nothing more than that. This can be his place to vent. This is not a time out because you are not setting a time limit (you controlling him). He returns when he is ready to control himself. You may have to return him to the designated spot before he gets the message. I like how you asked him if he was feeling better. I think it�s the perfect thing to say once he is calm.

Empathize with him when he has calmed down. �I can tell you were feeling very (mad, angry, upset, hurt, sad, frustrated). What can we do about that?� or �I can tell you miss the other home you were staying at. It makes you feel sad that you�re not there anymore.� Do some problem solving and give him words to use. He will then learn to better express himself.

When he is hurting himself, express your feelings. ""I'm worried you might get hurt. It upsets me when you do that."" Give him something to take his anger out on. You could give him a special pillow or find one of those punching clowns (just a throught). It may help redirect his anger from himself to another object.

Help him to feel powerful by saying thing like �Look how fast you can run! You did that by yourself! You stacked every block! You used so many colors on you picture!� These are intrinsic motivators rather than extrinsic rewards (""Good job,"" stickers, candy).These phrases are great ways to help your son feel powerful, gain confidence, and show attention in a positive way.",tantrums,,,,,,we hugged it out,we hugged it out,The biggest concern we have is when he gets really mad he will throw his head against objects or the floor.,tantrums,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Any advice on how to help a child that hurts himself?

What can we do?","try sneaking the fruits and vegetables into food he likes...pizza, spaghetti, jello, even icecream, give him foods that have a lot of vitamins in them, such as cereal and whole grain breads, since you are so concerned about his diet.
he also needs professional help.  it sounds like he is already receiving this, but, if not, he needs to talk to a therapist, even if his problems are nutritional.  after four years, it has probably developed into a more serious problem, and simply feeding him fruit won't fix everything.  now, i'm not endorsing the use of drugs, especially in someone so young, but they may be helpful if other treatments, such as counseling, diet & exercise changes, and behavioral therapy don't seem to work.  has he been diagnosed by a professional, or do you just think that he has depression and anxiety? he may have a learning disability, OCD, and/or social development problems, as well as the depression/anxiety. before treatment begins, he needs a definite diagnosis.  also, if he was diagnosed years ago, his problems may have changed or he may have developed new issues (this is fairly common).  find a psychiatrist that he and his father feel comfortable with, and follow their suggestions.  talk with a nutritionist and the boy's doctor about his diet, maybe they could explain to him how important eating healthy is, and what will happen if he doesn't, then tell him (and you) how to change eating habits.  set a good example for him, and offer healthy snacks after school.  it sounds like he does have a psychological problem, as well as a nutritional one, and he needs treatment for both.  make sure the therapist (find one that specializes in children) knows of your concerns about his diet, this is important information, and may dictate the proper treatment.
oh, and the physical problems, such as stomach aches, may actually be caused by depression. i know it sounds odd, but it's true.  the prolonged stress and sadness can cause stomach problems, headaches, clumsiness, etc.

79,2822108,help me now!!!!!!!!!!?,"first off, i have my period between the first 7days of the month. on april, i finished on the 8th and then i started taking the pill on the 10th. i usually take the pill every morning (between 0900h-1000h) until i travelled and lost track of time. basically, i took the pill on thursday the 13th at 0930h and friday the 14th at 1900h. Between those hours, we had sex. since yesterday, my breasts are really sensitve and my nipples are somewhat painful. i was also sleeping all day because of a headache.

NOTES:
I smoke occasionally
I hardly/ almost never have breast pains. 
I am expecting my period in about 12-14days","Chances are slim to none that you are pregnant.  It could very well be symptoms of the pill affecting you, or the traveling the different climates and what not.

Also there were times when I forgot to take the pill a couple days in a row and had sex within those days but never got pregnant.  I could be wrong cause the pill is not 100% safe towards pregnancy. I would continue with the pill if I were you and wait to see if you get your next period.  If not consult your doctor and go from there.  Good Luck!

It's good your brother is getting the care he needs.  Cellulitis is infection and can become serious, if he has active infection right now he should NOT be in therapy, when the infection has cleared it would be ok to treat again.  The swelling and heaviness of the fluid pressing on nerves can be very painful.  Alot of us with the condition have chronic and debilitating pain.  Has he been evaluated for fibromyalgia?  It tends to go hand in hand with lymphedema as does chronic fatigue, high blood pressure, thyroid issues, etc.  Restless leg and sleep apnea are other problems that we lymphers have too.  Pain patches probably won't help, you could try it but without the proper circulation and knowing exactly the cause of the pain, it might be a waste of money.

And humans make errors.  It is a known fact that the average delay in diagnosis of Endometriosis is 9 long years and takes over 5 physicians before a woman is given an answer to her pain.  Years of suffering in silence and being told it is in her head is a matter of course for most women and girls with Endo.  Therefore, you really need to be an empowered patient and educate yourself so that you can make the best choices for your case based on factual, timely information.  

It is wonderful to have a caring doctor in whom you have placed your trust, but doctors are not God and it is a known fact that there exists a disproportionate amount of erroneous info among many docs concerning this disease.  Just because someone is nice or means well, doesn't mean they can effectively treat the disease.

That said, there is an abundance of evidence-based and current info available in lay terms at www.endocenter.org.  You may wish to also speak with others by joining this support group at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/erc.

There is no definitive cure for Endometriosis, and a lot of the treatments are only temporarily, if it all, effective (and most come with side effects).  Your best bet is to find a surgeon who truly understands and treats only Endometriosis; surgical removal such as through excision can often afford an extremely high success rate for long-term relief and resolve of symptoms (versus medical therapy or superficial surgery like ablation, vaporization and other similar methods).  See www.centerforendo.com for more info on that.

You do not have to suffer.  While there is no cure, there are ways in which you can live well despite the disease.  Take an active role in your healthcare and you will do well.  Get the new book, ""Living Well with Endometriosis..."" by Kerry Ann Morris (available at all bookstores and Amazon.com).  It is highly regarded in the Endo community and applauded by many healthcare professionals.

Good luck and remember you are not alone.

I had sex on the morning of the 6th. since then I have been feeling some pregnancy symptoms, which i guess could also be pms stuff too. but i have never had these kind of things happen to me in pms. Like breast tenderness and fullness, exhaustion in the afternoon, even if i haven't done much all day, mild headaches, and also some nausea but not to the point that I would have to go to the bathroom. 
So could I be pregnant or is it just pms?","If you have any of these pregnancy symptoms, and have missed your period be sure to take an at home pregnancy test, it is almost certain that you are pregnant!! 

A missed menstrual cycle can be a sign of pregnancy. It is usually the first indicator of pregnancy, although some women claim to know they are pregnant before they miss a period, since your period is not yet due, you should take the other points into consideration;

Tender swollen breasts are another early symptom. While tender breasts are a symptom of an impending menstrual cycle, swollen breasts are not. Sore and swollen breasts with a tingling sensation can be an early indicator of pregnancy;

Fatigue can be another indicator of pregnancy, especially if other symptoms are present. A nap a day can help a pregnant woman maintain normal daily activities.

It seems that you are experiencing most of these symptoms and only the missed period has not been experienced, simply because the date of your next period has not been reached.

Conclusively ( I am no Doctor) I would put some stakes on 'you are pregnant'(I am no gambler either.

Has anyone else experienced this? I'm freaking out and having panic attacks that I can't just ""take it off"" there and then and that its there for years unless I pay to get it removed.  I don't know whats wrong with me.

Could I be misplacing my anxiety about other things onto the tattoo?  I'm very happy in life at the moment.

Maybe I'm freaking out because I'm stuck with the tat for now and its up to me to calm myself down. Could I be testing myself??

Any ideas appreciated :)","""I'm very happy in life at the moment.""

I think you may be experiencing something my cousin goes through. When her life is running smoothly; no confusion, no heartaches, no financial issues etc.. She will always find something to obsess about. She once said to me; ""I think I am freaking out because there is nothing wrong with my life now and it is like I am waiting for something to happen. Life can't be this good for long!"" It is like she is waiting for something to foul up the comfort zone she has found herself in. She will ""look"" for something to be worried about. ""I should not have bought that coat!"" ""This is the worst haircut I have ever had!"" So on and so on. Maybe you find yourself in a place in life where all is well and yet you really don't think you ""deserve"" it to be. I believe a lot of people feel this way at some point in life to a certain degree.

Maybe you never really wanted the ink and now your subconscious is playing on your mind. However;  there could be much more going on. Maybe a visit to the Doc is not a bad idea. You do NOT need to be ashamed of seeking help. People care, even those in your life you may think really don't. They will all understand if you see someone.

16,1683745,Lightheadedness again?,"My blood pressure has always been on the low normal side (98/54 one day); 106/72 another.  I thought about the BP, but since the lightheadedness remains a constant, I don't think this is the reason for it - hence the not mentioning it.  I ""feel"" that it's in my blood - sounds crazy, but true.  As for the anemia, I have normal iron levels - just a bit low RBC.  Hemocrit/Hemoglobin normal (low normal).  Another concern is my Bun & Creatinine levels rose during this blood work.  They've always been pretty constant & now they are higher than I've had, BUT AGAIN, STILL WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGES.  I've read that 1) RBC - low can cause lightheadedness, but again, docs need to get to the underlying cause of the low RBC & since I do not ""lose blood"" on a monthly basis anymore, the chances of me being iron-deficient anemic are quite low.  
2) Kidney disease can cause lightheadedness.  I really am fearful of this because Mom was diabetic & ended up with renal failure due to that.  I am NOT DIABET","Why do you think you can't be anemic just because you  are postmenopausal?  Bleeding and anemia can be caused by lots of things including slow internal bleeding.  It could be from an ulcer, esophageal erosion, it could be from the lower GI tract or all kinds of possibilities.  Since your blood levels are off some you need to talk to your doctor about this and see if he thinks this warrents further investigation or not. As for the lightheadedness you need to see the doc and get this looked into further.  Since it is a problem for you don't rest until the doc figures out what is going on.  As for kidney diseas this is something your doc can check for.  Because your mom was diabetic you are at a little greater risk of developing it which I realize you are aware of.

I hope i can help, i had a car crash 4 year ago, wrote off my car and the other persons car, i was driving, not my fault it takes a long time to come to terms with this kind of thing.  it is called post traumatic stress.  

A few sessions with counceling will not help, it is a long process and you need to keep going.  you can e mail me if you wish to talk about it, I am not a councelor but It may help to talk to others.

I tried to avoid the crash but could not avoid what was going to happen, luckily no one was killed just serious whiplash and a few bruises and pains.  Time heals even now I have never forgot about it but more come to accept it as unavoidable and thank the lord no one lost life that day.  I still get nervouse in traffic when I drive and it has had an impact on me as a driver but I just try to move on and it gets easier.   Fell free to mail me if you want some one to chat with it may help.  

Please consider going back to psychiatrist and give it a fair chance to work.  first few sesions is about getting to klknow you  and building up a trust with them before you will commit to talking to them I say possibly about 4 to 6 months before you feel better there.

good luck and be happy you are alive to tell the tale, many do not make it and we should all celebrate life and live each day as if it were our last because one day it will be.

I recommend, #1 see a dentist for a comprehensive exam and voice your concerns. #2 QUIT SMOKING (it increases your risk of periodontal disease). #3 Keep up with regual dental visits (often people with gum disease need to have cleanings and maintianance every 3-4 months). In most cases, someone as young as you are who practices good home care can reverse some of the loss or at least halt the disease in which case you could keep your teeth your entire life.

40,1145364,Is anyone scared that advances in medicine will make humans weaker in the long run?,"When a person before the age of ""modern medicine"" say 1900 or so had a terminal illness, natural selection and the absense of a cure would cause that particular person to die prematurely, in which case, they could not pass their defect or disease on to any offspring (if they didn't have any yet).

Now, medicine has evolved to where we are keeping people with serious diseases such as depression, diabetes, asthma, etc alive with drugs.

This hits on a personal note because I have serious asthma and probably would have died before the age of 5 if there wasn't today's medicine. Now I am worried about passing that on to any children I might have, and I'm considering not having any due to this and some other conditions I have, such as degenerated discs in my back at the age of 15. I'm 28 now....

My feeling is that the reason health care costs are astronomical is because each person has more problems today because we aren't weeding out the weak or defective.

Opinions?","if the theory of evolution holds, it's not humans who are getting weaker but the viruses are getting stronger. for each remedy we conjure or every treament we find, it may cure the ailment then, but eventually, stronger viruses evolve to overcome the treatments and drugs. Much like cockroaches, diseases come and go but always get stronger in the end. So there are more needs for stronger medicines to confront them. it may be that it may weaken the indivdual. The abundance of one cell leads to a shortage of another which is why people may appear to be getting more ailments than usual.

82,2456611,I wasn't going to ask this question. But who knows anything about gallbladders?,"I went to my doctor with bad pain in the upper part of my stomach, just below my breasts. I do have acid reflux. He felt around and it hurt on my right side too. He ordered an ultrasound. I am in between insurance and do not have any coverage until July. I can't afford to private pay. That was yesterday and I am still in pain. I am taking Nexium pills twice a day. 
I don't know if I am imagining all this, but now my right upper back hurts, but my left side hurts too. He asked me if I had black or tarry stools and I didn't until tonight....Now I do.. Have any of you had these symptoms? Or different ones? It seems as if everyone has something different...The other thing that concerned me is my temperature since yesterday is running about 99.2. 

I guess if the pain becomes unbearable I will go to the E.R. and they cannot refuse me care. Please let me know your experience with gallbladders.","Yes, you have all the symptoms of gall stones.  I also experienced a lot of pain in my shoulders and was told that is part of it. I found that if I stayed away from all fatty and fried foods I would feel a ""little"" better.  The attacks started becoming more frequent, it was like a band of pain around my back that was winding around to my solar plexus. When this happened, I was unable to lie down, sit up or anything else. I just couldn't get comfortable. The last attack came when I ate chili for dinner.  Wow! I ended up in the emergency room and after an ultra sound, was told I was off to the operating room. My Doctor told me it wasn't life threatening, the pain was from the gall bladder having spasms when the stone was blocking the bile which put me into almost a frenzy of pain.  I had the Old surgery, this was before the laproscopic surgery was around.  I lost 26 lbs through the ordeal as well.
Later, I met a friend who also had his gallbladder removed only his was gangerous!  If he didn't have surgery right away he would have died!  So it is nothing to fool around with, if you have another attack, go to the hospital for an ultra-sound where they will determine what needs to be done....in the meantime, plenty of fluids, rest as much as you can and be very careful what you eat.  Avoid spices, eat bland until this is taken care of.  I let mine go about a year and felt so good after that I am still shaking my head as to why I didn't do it sooner!
Also, eat very small amounts several times a day to avoid another attack.

85,2834243,What is the best way to deal with mild to moderate depression that doesn't deal with anti-depresants(MAOI)?,"I have struggled with bouts of depression and isolation for as long as I can remember. I have seen the adverse affects of anti-depresants on my father and the way that he continued to struggle. I am a single man in my early 20's, who attends a university, and works for nearly everything he gets. I feel that there is always something missing and I;m getting tired of trying unsuccessfully to discover what it is. I have tried spirituality and I'm very active in my church but I feel unsatisfied. I have read extensively about depression and seasonal affective disorders and have come across too much information on the subject. I need the advice of you, the person reading this at this time. If you have suffered the affects of depression and have overcome without the use of perscription drugs-please tell me how you did it, or useful resourses that might help me. Thank you.","I understand your desire to stay away from ""sledgehammer"" solutions. When it comes to your health, remedies that are stronger are not always better. I have three things that have gotten me through times when I've been depressed, and they're all gentle solutions that I think will suit an intelligent person like yourself. 

1 - The first is what Freud calls the ""talking cure"". He insists that it must be performed by a psychoanalyst who you are paying for, but actually I've performed it by writing in a diary. The key is to be very honest, and try to find connections that you might otherwise be supressing, because these are the areas that need work. For example, what's the first thing that pops into your mind when you think of ""depression""? If the answer is ""flying a kite"", then follow the chain... What do you think of when you think of ""kite"" and ""flying""... You'll be surprised how quickly this takes you right down to an event in your childhood or an unresolved conflict that might have happened a year ago.

2 - Looking for lies. A chair cannot make you depressed. A lampshade cannot make you depressed. Only another person can make you depressed. I believe it is because a chair and a lampshade cannot lie. Only a person can lie. Depression, it seems to me, comes from believing a lie. That conflict (between reality and the lie) takes up so much mental energy to maintain, it drains you as a whole. You may find, after using technique #1, that it leads to you to this conclusion #2. For example, after free associating your way to an event, you might find that it was when someone told you that you weren't worth a hill of beans. The problem is not that they insulted you, the problem is that you believed the lie. Beware, giving up on a lie that we've believed in for a long time is tougher than it sounds.

3 - This one is going to sound goofy, especially after wading in deeply with the other two techniques. Get some light to shine on the cells in the back of your eyes. Go outside for an extended period of time without sunglasses (no need to stare at the sun or a light-bulb, indirect light will do). Use one of those gentle light therapy products like www.everlyte.com . Take a trip on a sailboat. Spend a few hours in open fields on sunny days. It's those cells in the eyes that produce much of the chemical that those pills seek to replace.",depression,,Male,,I feel unsatisfied.,depression / seasonal affective disorders,I'm very active in my church,active in my church,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I have struggled with bouts of depression and isolation for as long as I can remember.,"I need the advice of you, the person reading this at this time.",,"If you have suffered the affects of depression and have overcome without the use of perscription drugs-please tell me how you did it, or useful resourses that might help me.",,"Yes: I understand your desire to stay away from ""sledgehammer"" solutions. /  I have three things that have gotten me through times when I've been depressed, and they're all gentle solutions that I think will suit an intelligent person like yourself.

I also have serious self-confidence issues. i don't know the situation i am in, and if desired i can tell more of how i am feeling.(i feel selfish saying that).if anyone is a phycologist, then i would appreciate your insight.","I'm not a psychologist, but I am a social worker. You do sound like you may have some depression and/or anxiety issues. The good thing is that you have already started the road to recovery by reaching out for help. Both depression and anxiety are very curable. I have had both of these, and counseling really helped me. 

Please know that when you are feeling like this is part of being down, and that things can get better. Your fears of not being good enough are very common to people who are depressed and people in general! I don't think there are many people who have not privately felt that they are not ""good enough"".  Self confidence can be learned. In the meantime, be gentle to yourself - you deserve it. 

You sound like you could benefit from going to counseling. There are many ways to do this. You can get a referral from a community information center or 211 if there is a 211 line in your area. If you do not have benefits at work, there are some non-profit agencies if money is an issue. Some faith communities have trained counselors as well.  If you have a good relationship with your family doctor, you could also talk to them about this and see if they have some referrals. I benefitted a lot from a book called Feeling Good by David Burns which should be in most major bookstores and libraries. Of course, there are many books that you might find helpful.

Just everything has to be very plain, no wheat, no sugar, basically no carbs, only veges and very lean protien. I had a gallbladder attack and they removed mine and I am only 27, after wards I did research and what I found out was very interesting, change your diet for a couple of weeks and see if that helps. I wish I would have known that, instead I had to lose a body part. I never had heartburn or issues before my attack, it just happened all of a sudden, but if you follow a low fat diet with no sugar you should be alot better in a couple of weeks.

Your stool is weird because your gallbladder is not releasing enough enzymes to break down the fat in your foods, so if you reduce or cut completely your fat intake your gallbladder will be able to catch up( I guess that is how you can word it).

Please try this before you have gallbladder surgery, I wsih that I would have known about this before I had mine out.

6,3087064,I need desperately need help?,"I used to self harm around the tome that I was using antidepressants. One of my teachers found out and told the counciler and they told my parents.At a regular medical check-up, my doctor told my mom that I seriously need psycological help. My mom did nothing. She didn't schedual an appointment for me to see someone after several reminders. Now I'm really freaked out because I stopped taking the antidepressants but there are still some left in the bottle. I just can't stop thinking about how it would be easy to swallow the rest of the pills and it might kill me. I've honestly just wanted to die lately. The only problem is if I try to get help, I'm afraid people will just think I'm trying to get attention, when that is NOT what I'm trying to do. I already my suicide note planned out, but like I said, it my suicide isn't complete, people will just think I'm looking for attention by the attempt. How am I supposed to get help?  Will someone please give me some much needed advice?","It is very common for people to feel guilty for asking for help. Many people feel like they are just trying to 'act sick for attention' or whatever.  I believe that you want help and think you need it. You are not acting and not just seeking attention even if that is what part of you might be whispering.  I don't know you, but it sounds like you are having a very awful time right now and I really do believe that you are of great importance to those around you even if that doesn't remotely seem true.  Heck, I happy to even have you here to be typing to you.  Death is just too final.  You are taking antidepressants so perhaps these feelings of suicide are coming from the mood disorder you are suffering from.  It is nothing to be ashamed of! many many people suffer from things like this.  Believe me that it can and will get better! This is just one phase of your life and you have so much more joy to confront as you continue to move through life.  Seek help.  Call up a help hotline, they can be very helpful.

Help is out there.  I hope i have done a bit to help you. It is not much, but I don't want you to keep the world from having someone as special as you.

Also, I don't know how old you are, but younger adolescents sometimes react poorly to antidepressants and it can make them suicidal.  Call up your doctor.  Find the number and just call him yourself if you don't think your mom will help.  This may or may not be the case, but something to ask your doctor about.

I will hope and pray that you will come to know how much of a joy you are to the world and that you will get past this and find out that this was a rough patch.... very rough.. but has passed.  It will pass.

7,3652629,Lo-Ovral question for ginecologist...?,"I'm going to start using Lo-ovral.  My ginecologist is using the pills to change my period cicle (to have no period in my wedding day and honeymoon).  I'm getting married on Dec, and I'm a virgin so I'm paranoid because I don't want to get pregnant. 
I started using the pills on nov 6

I'm going to use this pattern:
First pack: start on nov 6- end on nov 21
Second pack: start on nov 26 -  en on dec 14
third pack: start on dec 21- end the package..and continue normal usage.  

What are the probabilities of getting pregnant... does this increase my chances of pregnancy??  Do my future husband have to use a condom for the first month??  Second opinion please.. Thanks in advance.","I know you asked for Gyno help, but not only is someone on here probably not a Gyno even if they say they are, but Gyno's can be really deceptive at times.

Let me warn you about a couple of things with the pill (and yes, I took lo-Ovral and have since researched the pill a lot).  The biggest thing of concern is that some birth control pills work in a way that could cause early abortion.  As a matter of fact, it is the low dose pills (which most of them are low dose now-a-days) that do cause the early abortion, because instead of preventing ovulation, they tend to stop implantation, so an already fertilized egg (your baby) can not come to you for the nourishment it needs and therefore dies.  Most Dr's don't inform you of this, I didn't know about it until recently (and I haven't been on BC in years) and had I known it I would have NEVER taken it as I am morally opposed to abortion in any form.  Lo-Ovral is a lower dose hormone, it may not work for you.  It didn't for me, I bled through constantly the entire time I was on it, it was horrible.  They upped me to a higher hormone, and it worked for a while, but then I went back to bleeding all the time.  In addition to this, I had the other typical side effects, like weight gain (oh that really sucks, esspecially if you are about to get married) loss of sex drive (you are going to do it for the first time and likely not even enjoy it like you should!) etc...

BC can actually permenantly destory your sex drive.  If I were you (or if I could go back in time and change what I did) DO NOT TAKE THE PILL.  Use a condom, the effectiveness is near the exact same but without all the nasty side effects and possible moral issues.  They have female condoms too.  And, if you are really scared, use spermicide and other things.  None of this in natural, the act of sex is the act of creating a child, so no matter what there is going to be a possibility of pregnancy.  One thing to look into in NATURAL FAMILY PLANNING and tracking your BBT and cervical mucous.  If you are in love with your hubby, I won't stress out too much, even if you did end up pregnant, children are absolute blessings and you will cherish that ""accident"" for the rest of your life.

Main point: Save your body now while you can, don't cause permanent damage to your sex drive and etc when you have other alternatives.  Trust someone who has been there.

Hope this helps and goodluck and hope you wedding goes well!",Lo-Ovral,,Female,,,,,,I'm paranoid because I don't want to get pregnant,pregnant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,What are the probabilities of getting pregnant,does this increase my chances of pregnancy??,,,,,"Yes: Let me warn you about a couple of things with the pill (and yes, I took lo-Ovral and have since researched the pill a lot).

This hurt so much, and i was lost without her. she said so many hateful things to me, and i returned the favour to her. well after 1 month of not talking her mum called me and told me she was in the hospital and really really sick.

I went to the hospital and found she has cancer and wouldn't be alive much longer, she could barely talk. she told me that she pushed me away because she wanted me to get used to her not being there before she had to leave. She died the next day...

She was like a sister to me, and now I'll never get to see her again, why couldn't she just tell me, i feel so guilty about the things i said to her, how can i feel better about it? i just wish i could say sorry...","first of all, your friend was trying to protect you.  When things go wrong like that we as humans always seem to hurt the ones we love and those closest to us. maybe she was trying to safe you the pain and anguish of having to watch her die.and I am sure she was scared, both of dying and of how you might react.  It is always hard when a life ends with unfinished busines like this. I am sure if you knew the facts, then you would not have said these things to her, but i am sure she will forgive you.  WHen you went to the hospital did you tell her you did not mean what was said, as I am sure she appologised as well.  Only thing that can help is yourself, you have to accept that this was not under normal circumstances that this happened, and your friend did start by saying hurtful things to you.  People deal with things differently in life and this was her way off dealing with things.

Best advice I can give is for you to give it time, and if time is not the answer then find someone who you can talk to, a friend, doctor or a councilor.  Try going to her grave and talk to her tell her you are sorry.  Perhaps you can raise funds in her name for the cancer unit at the local hospital as away of easing the burden.

When was the last time you went to a doctor?  you need a blood work up to test for thyroid problems, lupus, diabetes, and other problems.  You need a physical definitely.  It almost sounds like a combination type problem of lupus, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia and possibly thyroid.  I have the 3 above and you get ""spells"" like that.  They come on suddenly and you are so tired you want to just crawl in bed and never get out.  

You said you've been to doctors and had tests, there are some very specific thyroid ones they need to check, not the standard, I think it's T3, T4 uptakes and there is another one I can't think of the name.  They also need to run lupus test, check for the antibodies. Lupus is hard to diagnose sometimes because the antibodies don't always show up unless you are in a full blown attack, which you are too tired and sick to make it to the doctors.

45,3389488,Pain after breast biopsy?,"I'm 22 years old an in June '06, I had two biopsies performed on my right breast for suspicious lumps that turned out to be fibroadenomas.  It took at least a month for the biopsy sites to heal and now I experience deep twinges of pain at the biopsy sites.  Is this normal?  I figure that they probably need a good amount of time to heal completely, since they were ultrasound guided core biopsies, but sometimes the pain is very disconcerting, even though the twinges don't last a long time.  Is it possible for the biopsies to aggrivate the lumps and cause them to become something serious?  Thanks!","No,it will not aggravate the lumps and cause something serious.
I had a biopsy with removal of my breast lump at the age of 30 (I am 53 now).
Though I know that if I am diagnosed with Fibercystic Disease as was the case, new lumps can appear any time for the rest of our lives.
I had a girlfriend who had to have so many lump removals due to this disease that she eventually went ahead and had all of her breast tissue removed and replaced it with implants.(Her breasts had so many dimples due to the lump removals that the implants helped to smooth out her breast and took away future worry about more lumps,removal and the possibility of cancer.)
The older we get the more we really need to watch them as they can turn cancerous.
Avoiding cigarettes,caffine and chocolate is suppose to help lessen the possibility of having more problems with future lumps but I guess God has been on my side as I continue all 3 of them and have not had any problems(having gone thru menopause I suppose there is a possibility that I could start having problems,but so far so good.

I'm really distressed about this because it's hurting those around me.","Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Symptoms

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is much more than the normal anxiety people experience day to day. It's chronic and exaggerated worry and tension, even though nothing seems to provoke it. Having this disorder means always anticipating disaster, often worrying excessively about health, money, family, or work. Sometimes, though, the source of the worry is hard to pinpoint. Simply the thought of getting through the day provokes anxiety. 

People with GAD can't seem to shake their concerns, even though they usually realize that their anxiety is more intense than the situation warrants. People with GAD also seem unable to relax. They often have trouble falling or staying asleep. Their worries are accompanied by physical symptoms, especially trembling, twitching, muscle tension, headaches, irritability, sweating, or hot flashes. They may feel lightheaded or out of breath. They may feel nauseated or have to go to the bathroom frequently. Or they might feel as though they have a lump in the throat. 

Many individuals with GAD startle more easily than other people. They tend to feel tired, have trouble concentrating, and sometimes suffer depression, too. 

Usually the impairment associated with GAD is mild and people with the disorder don't feel too restricted in social settings or on the job. Unlike many other anxiety disorders, people with GAD don't characteristically avoid certain situations as a result of their disorder. However, if severe, GAD can be very debilitating, making it difficult to carry out even the most ordinary daily activities. 

GAD comes on gradually and most often hits people in childhood or adolescence, but can begin in adulthood, too. It's more common in women than in men and often occurs in relatives of affected persons. It's diagnosed when someone spends at least 6 months worried excessively about a number of everyday problems. 

Specific Symptoms of this Disorder:
Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance). 

The person finds it difficult to control the worry. 

The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months; children don't need to meet as many criteria). 


restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge 
being easily fatigued 
difficulty concentrating or mind going blank 
irritability 
muscle tension 
sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep) 
Additionally, the anxiety or worry is not about having a Panic Attack, being embarrassed in public (as in Social Phobia), being contaminated (as in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder), being away from home or close relatives (as in Separation Anxiety Disorder), gaining weight (as in Anorexia Nervosa), having multiple physical complaints (as in Somatization Disorder), or having a serious illness (as in Hypochondriasis), and the anxiety and worry do not occur exclusively during Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). 

The anxiety, worry, or physical symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. 

The disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism) and does not occur exclusively during a Mood Disorder, a Psychotic Disorder, or a Pervasive Developmental Disorder",axiety disorder,,,,I'm really distressed about this because it's hurting those around me.,axiety disorder,,,"I worry, construct senario's in my mind and then worry about what if.",axiety disorder,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I think I may have an axiety disorder, how do I know?",,,,,No,,,

5,2964508,"why is my 3.5 year old giving me so problems with eating lately, and why the sudden temper tantrums?","she has recently been giving me a really hard time when it comes to eating. normally, she eats A LOT! it used to blow me away at the amount of food she could consume in a day, now i'm lucky if i get 1 meal a day in her. i know kids will eat when they are hungry, but it seems that she just isn't hungry. this has been an issue for the last 2 weeks. also, she has NEVER thrown a tantrum, until last night. she threw such a fit, and got so upset, and screamed so much, that she made herself cough until she threw up...3 times! what's the deal here?","Wow. The first thing I would check is her interaction with people over the past couple weeks. Is she in Daycare? Does she have a play pal she's spending a lot of time with? Does she have a caregiver at home if you work outside the home?

Sometimes kids at that age have observed another person behaving in a particular way in order to obtain the desired result 
(ie. a tantrum that gets a child an ice cream or toy they want). She might be trying out this new negotiation technique.

Another thing about 3 1/2, they are learning a zillion new things each day and their little heads are full, full, full. Imagine if you worked in an office and you had 20 projects you needed to complete and your boss came in and dumped a huge stack of stuff in your inbox and said, "" I need this ASAP"". You might grumble after the boss leaves, but a three year old faced with a proportionally simliar moment will fling themselevs onto the floor and scream and cry until all the bad stuff goes away.

Try simplifying her schedule for a couple of days and try going on a food field trip to the grocery store. Take your time and show her all the pretty produce and things she might like and get a cheap little notebook to carry around to write down the list of all the things she likes. Then when you do your shopping, you can get a few things off her favorite list each time so she has some say in what goes into her tummy. You could go through magazines and cut out pictures of food or use the google image option and make her a ""Menu"" like she's got her own restaurant. You can split it up in pages of breakfast, lunch and dinner and special snacks. She can go through the picture book and select what she will eat and then you can show her how to spell that word and maybe how to make the food item (like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich)

Both of my kids went through the ridiculously picky eater stage about that age. They will survive! My son is 6'2"" and a college rower and my daughter is 5'10"" and a volleyball player and coach.  The month my son would only eat cubes of baked potatoes, Stouffer's spinach souffle, pizza, Cheerios, PBJ's and hot dogs I thought I was gonna lose it! She will move through it.

Temper tantrum solution: This is weird but IT WORKS. When kids are out of control, it scares them as much as it scares you.
Get an ice cold cup of water and very calmly tell her to take a sip and calm down. If she won;t, tell her she can drink it or wear it. If she continues to flail and scream ( and I know this sounds bizzare) toss the water right in her face. She will come to a complete stop and you will have her full attention.

Go and get another cup of ice cold water and ask her if she is now ready to have a sip of water. She will drink it- trust me. And the cold and sipping motion will calm her down enough to regain control of her self.

I only had to do this ONE TIME with my kids. Any time I saw a tantrum coming from then on, I would ask them if they needed a glass of water and they would calm down and even go get themselves a cup.

Are the Doctors in that country for real, or is there something going on.

Or until you have sex with another infected person do you get it again after treatment a few years ago???","First of all, with this ""ping pong volley"" of chlamydia infection going on, you should know that there is strong probability of reinfection of this STD. For the infected person(s), there is a waiting time of at least a few weeks ,to a couple of months before they should engage in sex again, during treatment. A woman not treated could face possible infertility. STD's have no nationality or borders. Regardless of where she lives, one or both of you is not practicing safe sex!

Go back and get more specific. Ask for options or reading material. Do a Web search (www.webmd.com is a good place to start), and get your own information. Sometimes you have to take charge of your own care. 

You also should ask the school about adaptive teaching for you. This is a disability and they can make accommodations. My son has ADHD and needs extra time to complete papers becuase he has trouble focusing. He also takes his exams with a headphone playing classical music. It helps keep him from getting distracted by other things in the classroom.

I've done this, and as long as you are not in crisis, you can ususally do this - but do not rush into a GB FLUSH as it can be both painful and there is a small chance of pancreatitis (a stone spits into the pancreatic duct).

Instead even though your baby is crying, keep her on your breast so that she can keep stimulating your breast and that will tell your body that it needs to make more milk.  Change her from breast to breast if you have to and eventually within a couple days you will produce more milk.  Also drinking lots and lots of water is very important.  You need lots of it to produce milk.  Eating Quacker Oatmeal atleast twice a day also helps.  There are also some teas(Mothers Milk tea, feenugreek and reglan are some) that you can buy at a health store that you can drink too, to increase your supply.  I was doing the same thing with my daughter when she was born.  She kept crying too so I started supplementing because I also thought I wasn't making enough milk for her.  But like the above people have mentioned, your milk is still coming in and all that so don't panic.  I contacted La Leche League and they helped.

Emphysema is characterized by shortness of breath all the time, not necessarily yellow sputum, but like the other person answering said, anyone can get it, even by 2nd hand smoke.  It is also characterized by a ""barrel"" shaped chest.  Use a cool mist humidifier in your room to ease breathing and it will help loosen the congestion so you can cough it up easier.

I hope, for your son's sake, that it isn't anything serious.  I am lactose intolerant, and it's really annoying to have to check everything.  Lactose intolerence can actually start as a person gets older.  I didn't have a problem with dairy until I was almost seven.

The best advice I can give you for right now is to just make sure he's getting plenty of fluids (other than milk) and don't let him have any dairy for a while.

Most common ones though from what I've gathered have already be mentioned. Just know that you might not get text book symptoms, in fact, you might even experience something new.

How early is too early to test? I do believe 2 weeks after intercourse, you can test. Even more accurately one day after your missed period. I always suggest actually waiting until after you've missed at least a day of your period. If anything to give the HCG time to show.

Can anyone relate?","A tough question to answer because there is not enough info.  You stated your Grandmother has an enlarged heart and diabetes.  Does she have problems with CHF (Congestive heart failure)?  Is she using diuretics to get rid of fluid?  The use of diuretics can make the body dump sodium.  Also, normal kidneys can usually regulate sodium to keep a normal balance.  Diabetes long term is often the underlying cause of renal failure...so perhaps this is why the Doctors are concerned with her low sodium levels.  There are so many ""What & Why"" possibilities that her physician is really the only one with the answers. If the problem is caused by medications/treatment etc., adjustments can be made.  If the kidneys are not working adequately, then the problem is more complicated and it is possible that dialysis will be needed if your Grandmother decides to make that choice.

Are the odds against me?,"First off my husband had a vasectamy for his ex wife but then they divorced and he and I married and we want to try for a child of our own.  He had the surgery a little under 7 years ago, and in another post I saw that a man's body can develope antibodies against his own sperm after years of disconnection.    Is this true and how many years does it take?  Also he had rhumatic fever when he was a child which he says can render one sterile.  He has 2 children, but there's a very high chance that they are not biologically his anyway so that doesn't tell us anything.  So we have that goig agaist us, plus there's my situation.  When my mother had cancer I was her primay care giver.  One of her treatments was a high dosage of radioactive iodine and she was to be quarentined for many weeks.  As the weeks went on people could be with her more and more.  However since I was her primary care giver there's a chance I was exposed too much.  Can this cause fertility problems?","First off...my husband had a vasectomy reversal under similar circumstances.  Six weeks after he had the surgery, I was pregnant with our first daughter.  Our odds were only 5% that we'd get pregnant...that was two kids ago.  So ignore that anti-body bologna.

Secondly, radio-active medication would depend on exposure.  Keep in mind that your mom's situation is a WAS, not CURRENT.  

If I were you, I would go for a free consultation at your local fertility clinic.  The standard IVF procedure can run up towards 20K...so the clinic will be responsive to a free consult, but also realistic with your chances.

When it's all said and done, if your husband had two children with his first wife (let's just assume that at least one of them actual was HIS) you probably will have success with a reversal and resulting pregnancy.  Just reading about your amount of worrying makes me think you're ready.  Once you get pregnant...the worries only pile up...but they're definitely worth the headache and heartache.

I just read that hysterectomies don't necessarily cure endometriosis, especially if your doc leaves some in you when you have your hysterectomy, which mine did.

Wow, does this even make sense???","Now for a sensible answer that doesn't contain erroneous information recommending futile treatments or try to sell you supplements:

There is no definitive cure for Endometriosis, hysterectomy included.  Because Endo makes its own estrogen synthesizing enzyme, called aromatase, it is able to sustain its own life cycle even after hysterectomy.  If there is any disease left behind, it will continue to cause symptoms, period.  You need to have it removed via excision by an expert, such as Dr. David Redwine at www.endometriosistreatment.org or Dr. Albee at the Center for Endo Care in Atlanta at www.centerforendo.com.  Those specialists use excision - not ablation, vaporization or other superficial removal - and routinely excise all disease from all locations, including bowels, bladder, ureterus and other advanced areas.  Hang in there and don't mess around with local docs who say that it ""couldn't be removed"" - what they mean is, THEY couldn't remove it.

If they are not finding anything on scans, that is good news. 

The CA marker does not confirm anything.  A high result like yours can also be caused by an infection.  Benign conditions which can elevate CA 125 include infections of the lining of the abdomen and chest (peritonitis and pleuritis), menstruation, pregnancy, endometriosis, and liver disease. Benign tumors of the ovaries can also cause an abnormal test result. Because CA-125 can be high in many normal or benign conditions it is not useful as a screening test in large populations.

I think if something were malignant, it would be a higher result - over 60.

Its like she thinks she is taking a nap or something.  I recently quite my job and I have been staying up later at night.  I am wandering if this is a new faze or is it cause were not on a schedule anymore.  I am so exosted and don't know what to do.  I didn't even go to sleep last night cause she went to bed at 5am and then got up at 8am.  What is going on?  It's not like I am letting her stay up!  I try and try to get her to go to sleep!  HELP,"I am sorry for what is it happening, my daughter had that problem too until my mother gave me this checklist (very complete I may say) of things I should get rid off and things that I should do.
The checklist was not as nice as I will edit it for you, maybe it helps, good luck, honey!

THINGS TO CONTROL OR TAKE AWAY:

A. Sorroundings:

1. Strong lights at night.
2. Too much noise at night
3. TVs turned out late. The blinking lights keeps some children awake.

B. Diet
1. Anything in your daughter s diet that conteins caffeine or other stimulants, for ex. coffee, chocolate, tea, cinammon rollers (anything containing cinammon), give her milk sweetened with natural honey instead.

2. Too much solid food late at night. Keep the solid foods for before 4PM up until 6 PM max.

3. Too much sugar or sweetener in her food. You see, in toddlers sugar is a real booster, it is like jet gasoline in a car, be careful with it. Take away the soft drinks if you give her and substitute it with fruit juices (natural, please!).

4. A lack of salty foods. An desequilibrium of potassium make take away sleep (this is not my mother-s but my doctor-s advice). Give her a lot of vegetables. Tomato is a good one, carrot is another good one.

C.Activities

1. Children have at least 5 times the energy we adults have. It is amazing. She should do a lot of exercise during the day, that means that she is NOT in the age for a lot of mental activity, like watching TV, videos or that kind of stuff but dire hard physical one, she will endure it because THAT is the nature of toddlers. Get her a tricycle, she can wander around the house (you will be scared to know that she will actually do it ALL DAY.

2. She should not sleep at all during the day. Keep her excited.

3. If she has construction type toys, take them away for a while, for ex. building blocks or lego. That needs a lot of concentration that is probably building up stress in her. In other words, she keeps building those blocks during the night. That keeps her awake.

D. Relationships

1. I hope this is not the case, but fights or rows with your husband or partner builds a lot of stress in children. 
If this is the case, then you will have TO STOP it at Once, you are hurting your child. If this is not possible, keep the voices low or do not do it in front of her.

2. I hope this is also NOT the case, but do not be too strict with her, do not beat her, do not harass her, do not be too angry with her. If you live in confining spaces chances are that as a toddler she touches everything, exasperating you. Have patience. Better take her out for a walk to the nearest park. Do not be super protective. Sometimes children have to hurt themselves a little by themselves in order to learn.

3. Any brothers or sisters, or someone else in the family is making her life miserable? Watch out, please!

THINGS TO DO THAT CAN HELP A LOT!

A. Music:

1. Get some REAL relaxing soothing music, New Age will be good, but the ambient kind, for example, David Arkenstone. The music of Native American Indians (with all their pow wows dancing proved to  be Super super effective in making my child to go to sleep, I suppose it was because it resembles the rain somehow, you can get the CDs at 5US$ at amazon. But the best is Classic music, like for ex. Mozart, I can send you some tracks by email if you like. And do not put it loud, for heaven s sake! A low volume works.

Heparin is an anticoagulant (blood thinner); it must be used ONLY UNDER THE ORDERS AND SUPERVISION OF A DOCTOR, because it has a lot of side effects which can be very dangerous and even deadly, specially in a woman who has had several miscarriages AND is trying to conceive. It may actually worsen your condition if used improperly, because it will make you more prone to bleed. You should also avoid using aspirin and its derivatives {like ibuprofen[Motrin, Advil], naproxen[Anaprox, Aleve, Naprosyn] and Coumadin[another kind of anticoagulant similar to heparin]}. First of all, you should treat your underlying condition (thrombophilia= a disease that makes you to have an abnormally low platelet count). Platelets are one of the components in blood, which constitute the body's first line of defense in case of bleeding. Once stabilized, you might try to have another baby, but bear in mind that you are a VERY HIGH RISK patient, and another pregnancy could be harmful, to both you AND the baby-to-be. You should also consult an obstetrician that specializes in high-risk pregnancies for a second opinion and/or further advice or treatment in your case.

There is no distinction between the lymphatic system and immunological system.  In other words, there is no immunological system.  Various kinds of white blood cells are responsible for fighting infection.  During an infection, the white blood cells often work in the lymph nodes, which is why they sometimes become swollen during an infection.  

Sinusitis is usually a bacterial or viral infection that has nothing to do with genetics, so it can not be passed on to a child.  Cystic hygroma is a birth defect caused by chromosomal abnormalities.  This is a rare condition.  You might want to research Monosomy X, Trisomy 21 and Noonan's Syndrome if you are looking for more information on cystic hygroma, as these are often the cause of the defect.  Allergies and bronchial asthma can run in families, but do not cause birth defects.

How can I 'wake up', how can I 'heal' and start to feel like I am alive?","This is a tough one.

To feel completely separated from your sense of Self and your body goes hand-in-hand with eating disorders. Do you self-injure, too?

An eating disorder is actually a means of someone asserting control over their life when they feel they have very little. It is rarely a symptom of someone who wants to be thin, though it's very common that someone w/an eating disorder hates themself and wants to do themself harm.

Bulimia is a very common disease with successful, charismatic women who endure a lot of stress at work or in life in general.

I had to come at my bulimia and self-harm from a few different angles. Firstly, I got myself a good book -- The Secret Language of Eating Disorders by Peggy Claude-Pierre. I read it and took note of the things she said that resonated with me most.

I saw a therapist once a week for two years. It was pricey but completely necessary. It helped more than I can describe. Just telling someone about how awful you feel and how alienated you think you are, and having them console you and validate your feelings, is powerfully healing.

Start to write down things you like about yourself. Keep track of details  during the day that make you feel connected to yourself. Treat yourself to things throughout the day -- a positive thought, an inside joke with yourself, a cup of tea, anything.

I can relate to wanted to go back to your eating disorder. It feels safe and consistent and when you look at yourself and see your body as the result of your own control, well, it feels great. A therapist will help you with this. find a support group and meet with the people there.

I get slight stomach aches and headaches. My heart is beating so fast most of the time. Are there posibilities that i can be pregnant?","If you are having hetero sex there is ALWAYS the possibility of pregnancy.  

Take a deep breath and calm down.  You are still not late. A woman's hormonal cycle can vary widely, especially under duress.  Any recent stresses; change of diet, change of birth control method (chemical particularly), lack of rest, relationship issues, exercise, meds, diseases and so on can affect your body and that will reflect on your menses in different ways.  Heavier, lighter, early, late- you may even miss one!  So relax a little ;) 

The stick can give false answers, especially if it's too early or you are skipping a period.  Most manufacturers of those products suggest re-testing in 3 days.  hCG is a hormone that is measurable within about 10-14 days of conception with home products and most of the times the GYNs will rely on them. If you are still unsure you can get tested at a lab, a local women's clinic, your gyn office or health care provider.  Let your fingers do the walking across the local yellow pages.

One doctor told me it shoudl be operated as they could move and go in some duct while others told me not too. the glabladder is not full at all, there are just few, day 10 little stones. Do you have experience about it? suggestion?thanks","The most common disorder of the biliary tract (gallbladder and bile ducts) is gallstones. Why and how gallstones form is not fully understood, but it is thought that in some cases an abnormality in function causes the gallbladder to remove an excessive amount of water from the bile so that some of its constituents can no longer remain in solution. Gallstones occur very frequently in developed countries and may be associated with eating a diet that is high in fat and refined carbohydrates and low in fiber. As many as 10-20 percent of the U.S. population over the age of forty have gallstones, but only in a minority do symptoms occur. If gallstones are found by chance on an X-ray taken for some other reason it is standard practice to leave them alone if they are causing no symptoms, since the risk of developing problems is slightly less than the risk from a major operation. However, if a patient with asymptomatic gallstones is having an abdominal operation for another reason, the gallbladder may be removed at the same time. The problems that gallstones can give rise to are various and include cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder), choledocholithiasis (gallstones in the common bile duct), and cholangitis (infection of the bile ducts), pancreatitis, and gallstone ileus (obstruction of the intestines by a gallstone).
Make sure you eat a low fat diet, lose weight and exercise. This will help prevent the need for an operation. As a nurse personally I would try the diet with the tablets you have first THEN the operation if dieting didn't help.

You will feel tired following the procedure because of the anesthetic and pain medication you have been given.

2. You will have some soreness of the throat. The pain may get worse before it gets better. It is important to take your pain medication as prescribed by your surgeon. With the sore throat you may not feel like taking anything by mouth. Even so, you must drink fluids. A cool mist humidifier can be soothing for your throat.

3. You may experience pain in your ears. This is common during the first week.

4. You will have bad breath from scabs where the tonsils were removed. These scabs fall off in about 7 to 10 days, and your breath odor will return to normal. Do not gargle, as this will hurt and may cause bleeding. Rinse your mouth with any antiseptic mouthwash.

5. Diet: eating may not be possible right away. The first day you should favour: clear fluids such as water, apple juice, Gatorade, and popsicles. Avoid: citrus juices and carbonated beverages (colas) because they may cause increased pain and throat irritation. After a few days start trying foods that are easy to swallow. Favour: Jello, soft noodles, warm broth, puddings, yogurt, and ice cream. Avoid: steamy, hot, or spicy foods or hard, crunchy foods.

6. Avoid constipation, be sure you include plenty of liquids in your diet. You may require a mild laxative.

7. You may return to work in about 1-2 weeks. Most adults need about 1 week to recuperate and return to a more normal diet.


What should I avoid following my tonsillectomy?

1. You are not to drive a motor vehicle for 24-48 hours. Follow your physician's instruction regarding any alternate or additional restrictions.

2. You must have a responsible adult accompany you home and stay with you over night.

3. No beer or alcohol for 24 hours.

4. Do not sign legal documents or make important decisions for 24 hours.

5. Do not operate machinery or perform tasks requiring skill, coordination, or judgement within 24 hours after your procedure.

6. Do no participate in any physical fitness or contact sports for 10 days to 2 weeks.

When should I call the doctor?

1. If you have bleeding other than blood tinged saliva, bleeding more than 2 tablespoons of blood or you vomit blood, please inform your surgeon at once. If you cannot reach your surgeon, go to the Emergency Department of the nearest hospital.

2. You may have a slight fever (38�C or 100�F) for a couple of days. If fever persists for more than 48 hours and or you develop chills, contact your doctor.

3. Should you develop any other problems or have any concerns, please contact your doctor at his/her office or go to the Emergency Department.",tonsillectomy,25-34 years old,,,,,,,There might be complications/ severe pain after surgery,tonsillectomy,,,,,,,,,Will these problems go away after surgery?,tonsillectomy,,,My doctor seems to think so but I have doubts.,tonsillectomy,,,Any suggestions/ precautions/advise,Please help!!,,,Anybody been through such a problem,,No,,,

You can have one and see something in the uterus as early as 4 and a half weeks (I did). Because you are six weeks, they should see a heartbeat.

My Doctor advised me to continue taking Insulin 30/70 through out my life. Most people are advising me that Insulin will affect the nerves in future and taking pills is enough. Now it is normal in urine and sugar and fluctuates now and then and not so serious.But my Doc strictly recommending me to take 20ml.insulin in the morning and 10ml. in the night and no pills. I am confused in this aspect whether i have to continue lifelong or not. Still i never failed to take injection everyday in the morn and night. Kindly guide me whether taking insulin continuously will spoil my life.,"There are two types of diabetes, they are called type 1 and type 2.
Type 1 diabetes is usually detected at an early age, my daughter was 9.  The pancreas makes the part of your blood that carries the sugar to the muscle.  When the pancreas stops making this, the muscle has to look somewhere else for sugar to make energy.  During this time, all the sugar that you eat stays in your blood  (this is what gives your the high numbers), also  when the muscle is getting is energy from other places it puts toxins into your blood which come out in the urine  (this is what gives you high ketone levels)

It is very important to follow what the doctor tells you!!! You need to write down every time you test your bood and what the sugar level was.  Normal blood sugar should not go above 140.  If the amount of insulin that you are taking is not keeping your blood sugar down, make an appointment with your doctor right away and have them change your dosage.  Never try to change the dosage yourself!!  

Your doctor may also referr you to a diabetic clinic.  These people work closely with monitoring insulin dosages as well as teaching good nutrition and meal planning.

Don't get discouraged, it can take time to get your insulin dosage set right for you.  It took my daughter a year and a half, which also included changing to all different types of insulin, different times of day for shots. You are not alone, there are so many wonderful people and support groups just waiting to help, all you have to do is ask.  (That goes for me too, if you ever need to talk, send me an email).

Getting back to the rest of your question:  
Only type 2 diabetes can be controlled by pills and diet. And last of all, and maybe most inportant;  taking insulin continuously can only SAVE your life.

If you want more detailed information about diabetes, search for American Diabetes on the web or ask your doctor.

I wish you all the best!!!!!!!!!Please let me know how you are doing.",Insulin for Diabetes,,,,whether taking insulin continuously will spoil my life.,Insulin for Diabetes,,,whether taking insulin continuously will spoil my life.,Insulin for Diabetes,,,,,,,,,,,I am confused in this aspect whether i have to continue lifelong or not.,Insulin for Diabetes,,,,,Whether i have to continue life long?,Kindly guide me whether taking insulin continuously will spoil my life.,Kindly guide me whether taking insulin continuously will spoil my life.,,,,"Yes: my daughter was 9.

35,1446125,"The way this world works, will diabetes ever be cured?","From Wikipedia:
Exubera, inhalable insulin developed by Pfizer, was approved for use in 1-2006. In 4-2006, the UK's NIH advised against the use of inhalable insulin on the grounds that avoiding injections did not justify the higher cost of the new product, estimated at �1100 per year. The NIH recommended in 6-2006 that diabetics should use Exubera only if they could establish 1) a medically proven fear of insulin injections or 2) chronic problems with their insulin injection sites.

Novo Nordisk, filed a lawsuit against Pfizer on 8-2006, claiming patent infringement, seeking both compensatory damages and injunctive relief. Novo sought an injunction preventing the release of Pfizer's 9-2006 launch of Exubera. A federal judge delayed a decision on Novo Nordisk's request for injunctive relief until 12-2006 court hearing. Pfizer's answer contends Novo wants to deny diabetics access to Exubera because it's the only FDA approved inhalable insulin & would hurt Novo Nordisk's business.","When was the last time any big moneymaking disease was cured?

now she will re gain part of the lost functions because after a stroke, edema of the brain develops and is maximal a couple of days after the onset of stroke, this edema will cause even more functional loss but it is reversible, with time (weeks) the edema subsides and the neurons return to normal function. anyway, she still has a dead part of the brain but other parts of the brain can take the function of the dead tissue and so she may regain more functions and that's done by physiotherapy. rehabilitaion is very important for her.

no one can diagnose a stroke from a missed call, take it easy on yourself, there was nothing you could do.

Any help would be much appreciated, thanks!","My daughter has suffered with eczema since she was born.  The doctor recommended Eucerin cream in the jar for her.  That worked very well.  As far as something that you can use, you could try the Oil of Olay cream that you use just before you get out of the shower.  You rub it on and then rinse it off and pat your skiin dry.  It works very well.  Or you could use one of those spray on oil mists that you spray on in the shower, rinse off lightly and then pat your skin dry.  Eucerin also has a cream in a pump bottle that works well and doesn't leave your skin too greasy feeling.  My daughter has been lucky enough to have outgrown most of her eczema problems, which the doctors said she would probably do.

Birth control helps a LOT of women, and I wouldn't necessarily give up on it (unless you are trying to get pregnant, obviously) but it is not a universal cure for what ails you.  It conceals your symptoms... it does not treat the underlying issue.

Unless you have a diagnosis for why your periods are so difficult (Endometriosis, PID, Ovarian Cysts, Fibroids... lots of options, and it's not possible to diagnose over the web) then your doctor should not be just dismissing your problems with ""birth control"" as if that is the only cure.

and if i`m erected with the foreskin behind the glans (force retracted), its very painful!!!

is this a phimosis??
and..., when do boys usually have their prepuce retracted?
thanks very much..........","Phimosis is a medical condition in which the foreskin of the penis of an uncircumcised male cannot be fully retracted. The word derives from the Greek phimos (_____, ""muzzle""). The term is confusing because it is used to denote both a physiologic stage of development (i.e., not a disease), and a pathologic condition (i.e., a condition that causes problems for a person). Elasticity and ambiguity of definition are especially common when referring to infants. Conflicting incidence reports and widely varying post-neonatal circumcision rates reflect looseness in the diagnostic criteria 2,3. Phimosis has become a topic of contention in circumcision debates (see 14 and Medical analysis of circumcision).

Phimosis in most but not all infants is physiologic rather than pathologic, whereas phimosis in older children and adults is more often pathologic than physiologic. Some have suggested that physiologic infantile phimosis be referred to as developmental nonretractility of the foreskin to more clearly distinguish this normal stage of development from pathologic forms of phimosis 10.

27,3735349,Serious infertility question--need some advice from the ladies.?,"I am 32 yrs old...a coach, a teacher, a person who loves to work with kids...who got married 10 years ago to a woman who already had a son.  I found out a year into our marraige that I could not have my own child.  This, of course devastated me.  I have a good relationship wih my stepson, but it is not the same.  My wife refused to adopt.  I yearn for the father-child relationship that I have for whatever reason been deprived from having.  I have a rotten relationship with my wife.  Sex is non-existant...there is no intimacy.  Im losing my mind.  I want to leave and see if there is any hope of starting over but am afraid of the thought of dating and mentioning that I cannnot have kids.  What do I do?  Are there good girls still left for a 32 year old like me?  I just want to be #1 to somebody.","There are tons of other fish in the sea.  And there is surely one out there just for you, that has a more similar perspective than the woman you are currently with.

29,305868,i don't understand the value of treatment?,"Two years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, PTSD due to severe childhood sexual and physical abuse, and borderline personality disorder.  I hadn't tried to get any help before then, and was involuntarily committed because my roommate caught me drawing pictures with my blood (note to self: keep doors locked).  The doctors gave me a bunch of drugs that made me fat (I gained fifty pounds), so i quit them, and went crazy again (I threw blood on someone, but they deserved it).  So I spent another couple of months in the hospital and stayed fat.  Now I'm out, again, and have been off medication for nine months and am losing weight.  Aside from that I hate myself and sometimes I burn myself and sometimes I have panic attacks if I'm in sexual situations I'm doing pretty well.  All the doctors (at least the ones I can afford) want to do is pump me with medications that make sleepy and stupid and lazy.  Is it really such a problem that I'm not in therapy if I'm only a danger to myself?","The value of treatment is to offer you a chance to get a little relief from your emotional stress (it is EXHAUSTING to change moods fast, control anger, maintain relationships with family and friends, hold down a job, etc. when all of these goals conflict.) The world isn't easy for anyone, but it's exponentially harder when you're fighting depression, the desire to cut and maim yourself, uncontrollable compulsions, extreme anxiety and miscellaneous other pressures. You can choose not to continue therapy, but honestly you can live a more balanced life. You might have to change doctors a few times, and will DEFINITELY change medications more than a few times. Bipolar disorder is a chemical imbalance that requires medication to balance. And PTSD can be controlled with therapy. But you have to be willing to work with someone, and be patient. Its a long, hard road. But you have every right to a happier life. And I urge you to pursue it.","bipolar disorder, PTSD, and borderline personality disorder",,,,All the doctors ... want to do is pump me with medications that make sleepy and stupid and lazy,"bipolar disorder, PTSD, and borderline personality disorder",,,,,The doctors gave me a bunch of drugs that made me fat,"bipolar disorder, PTSD, and borderline personality disorder",,,,,,,,,i don't understand the value of treatment?,"bipolar disorder, PTSD, and borderline personality disorder",Aside from that I hate myself ....I'm doing pretty well.,"bipolar disorder, PTSD, and borderline personality disorder",,,i don't understand the value of treatment?,Is it really such a problem that I'm not in therapy if I'm only a danger to myself?,Is it really such a problem that I'm not in therapy if I'm only a danger to myself?,,,,Yes: But you have every right to a happier life.,,,

Now i'm currently on my period after months not having 1, now with heavy bleeding, clots, woozyness and  bad headaches. Today i had so much clotting that it came out on the floor it was alot considering how much blood is actually suppose to flow? Why am i feeling woozy and tired? What is this a sign of, and I know i should see a doctor, but like many others..thar fear is hauting me.","First off, take a deep breath and relax.  You are ok.  Next, call your doctor.  This is exactly the sort of stuff your ob-gyn is trained to handle, and will understand your situation.  Having PCS makes your periods a bit screwy as your hormones don't really act quite the way they should.  

Your doctor can evaluate you to find out 1) why you are clotting and to see if anything else is wrong with you (thyroid issues can make things go squirly too).

You are feeling woozy and tired most likely from the blood loss.  Losing a lot of blood can make you dehydrated, and anemic.  So rest, drink water, take a pain killer for the cramps and call your doctor.  

Good luck.  I know how scary this can seem, I have been through it myself, and for me it turned out to be nothing - some water, and a few weeks or iron pills for the anemia and I was fine.

0,3672031,Tremendous pain in head and nerves while flying?,"Hi,

I feel heavy pain while I fly in plane. This happens especially when the plane starts landing. I feel the pain in the skull in the upper part of skull over eyes. The pain is unbearable and I feel tremendous pressure in my head and nerves start heavily stretching. I feel that the nerves in the head will blast. Please note that I feel heavy pain in the area near to eyes both sides of the face. This happens only at the time of landing and not the take-off. I am really worried of this situation and I am scared of flying now. I've felt this type of pain eight times of out of nine times I flied. Please provide some suggestion what kind of problem it could be. Please let me know if you have any idea about what kind of problem I may have or if any more details regarding to my problem.","Airplanes are pressurized, but they aren't pefect.  Pressure inside the plane probably drops just a hair below atmospheric pressure as the plane ascends, and once again increases back to atmospheric pressure as it descends.

Your head, especially the face, is full of air pockets called sinuses.  In addition to the sinuses that you see people complaining about in TV ads (i.e. the maxillary sinuses), there are the ethmoid sinuses, sphenoid sinuses, and frontal sinuses, plus others that I don't believe commmunicate with the external environment.  All of these sinuses are connected with the external environment via openings into your nose (you cannot see them, but an ENT physician deals with them all the time).  These openings allow the air pressure in the sinuses to equilibrate with the environment.  Furthermore, your middle ears are connected to the external environment via the Eustachian tubes which open into the nasopharynx.  Similarly, the pressure in the middle ear equilibrates with the pressure of the environment.

Sometimes, however, the openings of these sinuses in the nose can become obstructed for various reasons--infection being one of them.  Same situation with the Eustachain tubes.  I recall, as a child, having severe pain in my ears while on a plane.

This is where my knowledge is really lacking, but I'll give it a try.  I do know that middle ear infections are often very painful because of pressure accumilation due to obstructed Eustachian tubes (either obstructed or inflamed to the point where they no longer drain well into the nasopharynx).  Presumably the same applies to the sinuses in your face.  Inability to equilibrate with the environment, even if it's low pressure, may translate into pain.

You might want to ask your ENT about it, though.",pain in head and nerves,,,,,,,,I feel heavy pain while I fly in plane,pain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Please let me know if you have any idea about what kind of problem,I am scared of flying now,,,,,"Yes: You might want to ask your ENT about it, though.",,,

AUTISM, AUTISTIC, ADHD, ADD, Coma Brain Damage, Special Autistic Kids Treatment Cure By our Master Tole .
 

These Autism , Epilepsy, coma, brain damage etc has been on our research and treatment top list from 1984 .  



Master Tole practices the complete Ancient Chinese Way of THE TOLE'S WAY OF MEDICATIONS in the modern Autism Treatment Cure -since 1984 for Autism.  
Each Autistic kids are not the same, different in a few or more conditions and also recovery condition , also lever and rate of recovery.  



(8)Autistic Kids.
1. Autistic Kids Disorder 
Autistic Kids symptoms:

(A) total of six (or more) items from (1), (2), and (3), 
with at least two from (1),
and one each from (2) and (3): 


1. Autism Autistic Kids qualitative impairment in social interaction, as manifested by at least two of the following: 
(a) Impairment in the use of multiple non-verbal behaviors such as eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression, body postures, and gestures to regulate social interaction 
(b) failure to developed relationships appropriate to developmental level

(d) lack of social or emotional response


2. Autism qualitative impairments in communication as manifested by at least one of the following:

(c) repetitive use of language or words or phases
(d) lack of varied, spontaneous make-believe play or social imitative play appropriate to developmental level 


3. Autism restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities, as manifested by at least one of the following: 
(a) autism encompassing preoccupation with one or more stereotyped patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus 
(b) autism apparently inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional routines or rituals 
(c) stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms (e.g., hand or finger flapping or twisting, or complex whole-body movements or with an object) 
(d) autism persistent of liking an object, movements with sound.


(B) Delays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas,

(2) language as used in social communication, or 
(3) symbolic or imaginative play (playing or talking some form of outer space words or cartoon's words or play). 


Symptoms of Asperser's include: impaired ability to utilize social cues such as body language, irony, or other subtext of communication; restricted eye contact and socialization; limited range of encyclopedic interests; preservative, odd behaviors; didactic, verbose, monotone, droning voice; concrete thinking; over-sensitivity to certain stimuli; and unusual movements. 

All these are the symptom of autism and we have the treatment for all these problem. You have to spend enough time for the intensive treatment in order to get good result, it varies from 1 month to 6 months or more for intensive treatment (remedies, remedy).
Some of the Autistic kids that is difficult to get near to 100 % cure is that they started late on themselves more then 11 years old for some, and others are too stubborn, but we still gets major improvement about 80-90% or so until they can get easy living in their life.
We have long distance friends that",I think that this like many other things that have come and gone in the past years is unfortunatly not a cure.  People are always claiming that a diet or something is going to cure autism.  I work with children with autism and I've never heard about this working.  I know 5 years ago when they thought vaccines may be causing autism it was all over the news.  I think if it did it would be on the news and all over the place - because a cure for autism would be a big deal.  This may be a good treatment for some children but I don't think cure is the right word.

12,3689869,Congestive Heart Failure Life Expectancy?,"What is the average life expectancy of someone who is in stage 3 of Congestive Heart Failure.  I have a friend who seems to not care.  He is a 47 year old male who drinks daily, smokes 1 pack of cigarettes a day and consumes a high sodium diet.  He has extreme fatigue, shortness of breath and nausea.  His back heart muscle has been diagnosed as extremely weak and he does not take his heart meds.  I'm concerned for his children and would like to know what to expect.","As someone who, like your friend, developed heart failure in middle age (I was 49 at the time), I can tell you that his life expectancy is directly related to how well he takes care of himself.  And that, of course, is bad news for your friend.

As you realize, he is doing everything wrong.  The shortness of breath would be relieved if he lost weight, gave up the cigarettes and dropped the sodium.  I don't know what medications he was prescribed, but probably at least one of them would help him shed the fluid that may be getting into his lungs and making it harder for him to breathe.  

It's no wonder he is always fatigued.  How would anyone feel if they have reduced heart function and reduced lung capacity?

As to his other meds, there are wonderful drugs now that can lighten the load on his heart and make it easier for the heart--the part that's still funtioning--to do its job.  If he doesn't take them, he is overstressing the working portion of his heart as it tries to do the job of the entire organ.  It can't, at least not without help.

The nausea is a very worrisome symptom.  That one suggests angina, which sometimes comes out that way.  His poor heart, overworked as it is, may be sending out distress signals which are perceived as nausea.  

Depending on how much alcohol his is consuming, daily drinking may or may not be a problem.  One or two drinks a day (NO MORE, and NO doubles) actually seems to benefit the heart.  But some people think that if one is okay, four must be great.  It's not.  The beneficial aspects of alcohol completely reverse if you have more than about 2 drinks (just one for a woman).

Overall, this man needs to go back to his doctor and lay all his cards on the table.  Could he be depressed and ""giving up""?  That is very common with heart patients.  He needs to tell his doctor *everything* he is doing and not doing, and why.

I believe that patients have rights, and so does your friend.  But he also has children, which means he has a responsibility to be around for them until they are well established on their own.

Thjis really made me panicc but i also thought of the possibility of a hemmorhoid, since after i wiped, i was very itchy and when i wiped again fresh blood was on the paper which made me think that the blood was added to the stool on the way out due to a hemmorhoid i might not know about..Anyways i reallly just wnated to see some opinions, and try to ease my mind...thanks","Hi Nic

I seriously doubt you have cancer, but be sure to do a colon cleanse. You must remove the toxins in the body and if you dont have regular healthy bowel movements, that is what causes illness and disease because the toxins get into the blood stream. 

Educate yourself on cleansing and drink at least a gallon of distilled water a day. Be sure to also get more nutriton especially raw vegetables.

Best of health to you

25,605784,"Seeing doctor on the 26th, can anyone research and collect what could be wrong with me?","Background:

Dec 04 I was diagnosed with a 43 lb ovarian tumour on one of my ovaries, surgery removed the tumour as well as half of my ovary.

Symptoms:
Now I'm experiencing all of the same symptoms as last year, except now my breasts are hurting - my aunt tells me my lymph nodes are swollen. They are very firm and bumpy, very sore.
My legs are absolutely killing me. They ache and cramp.
Where my uterus is located is very firm and is enlarged, it pulses from time to time and feels as though it's cramping (my period is due on or around the 27th).
I feel exhausted, I can sleep for well over 12 hours, I feel drained - this is one of the symptoms I had last year too.
My appetite has definitely grown, another symptom I had last year.
I feel sick to my stomach.

What else could this possibly be? 
Would my breasts and legs hurt sooo much if I have another cyst/tumour growing on my ovary?","i know that people usually have several cysts, but only one starts growing and when it becomes dangerously big they remove it. but the reason why it started growing remain. so that near one which was small can start growing too. so i won't be surprise if u have another cyst grown.

26,436504,Young IBS?,"My 11-year old daughter has been experiancing some constipation and problems with her bowel movements for the past few months. I've taken her to the doctor, because it sounds like she's inherited my IBS. The doctor said that it's too early to diagnose IBS, but to give her this stuff called 'Mirilax' which seems to be doing okay. My question is, is it possible she's inherited my IBS, or should I just ignore my worry?","It is not too early to diagnose IBS in your daughter and I think you're probably right.  The Mirilax will only help with elimination and not get to root of problem I'm sure you realize.  

There appears to be four main causes of IBS: stress, insufficient intake of dietary fiber, food allergies, and meals too high in sugar. Stress increases the motility (the rhythmic contractions of the intestine that propel food through the digestive tract) of the colon and leads to abdominal pain and irregular bowel functions.

Dietary fiber promotes proper colon function. Patients with constipation are much more likely to respond to dietary fiber than those with diarrhea. Increasing intake of dietary fiber from fruit and vegetable sources rather than cereal sources may offer more benefit to some individuals.

Food allergy as a cause of IBS has been recognized since the early 1900s. More recent studies have shown the majority of patients with IBS (approximately two-thirds) have at least one food allergy, and some have multiple allergies. The most common allergens are dairy products (forty to forty-four percent) and grains (forty to sixty percent). Many patients have noted marked clinical improvement when using elimination diets (see FOOD ALLERGY for further discussion).

Meals high in refined sugar can contribute to IBS by decreasing intestinal motility. When blood sugar levels rise too rapidly, the normal rhythmic contractions of the gastrointestinal tract slow down and in some portions stop altogether. A diet high in refined sugar may be the most important contributing factor to IBS being such a common condition in the United States.

What nutritional supplements should I take for Irritable Bowel Syndrome?

Foundation Supplements. There are three products from Natural Factors that I think are critical in supporting good health:

    * MultiStart (age and gender specific multiple vitamin and mineral formulas). Follow label instructions.
    * Enriching Greens - a great tasting ""greens drink"" containing highly concentrated ""greens"" like chlorella, spirulina, wheat grass juice, barley grass juice, etc., and herbal extracts. Take one serving (one tablespoon) in 8 ounces of water daily.
    * RxOmega-3 Factors - A true pharmaceutical grade fish oil supplement. Take two capsules daily.

PGX with Mulberry Extract from Natural Factors. PGX is a special soluble fiber blend that is primarily used to help control after meal elevations in blood sugar. However, it is extremely useful as well as a gastrointestinal tract tonic in patients with IBS. Take 2-4 capsules 5 to 15 minutes before meals.

RevitalX is a high potency multi-nutrient powdered drink mix formula from Natural Factors. The product was developed by Michael Lyon, M.D., and specifically engineered to be an excellent source of important nutrients to support the gastrointestinal lining and aid detoxification. It is an excellent source of hypoallergenic vegetarian protein that we have termed GoldPeptides along with specific nutritional, probiotic, and herbal support to the digestive system. Take one serving daily.

Peppermint Oil Complex with Oregano Oil from Natural Factors provides volatile oils from peppermint, oregano, and caraway seed oil in an enteric-coated capsule so that it does not break down in the stomach but is instead delivered to the small and large intestine. Preparations containing peppermint oil in enteric-coated capsules have been shown to be very effective in IBS. Take one or two capsules three times daily twenty minutes before meals.

Probiotic supplements supplying Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacteria species are very important in IBS. Take a product that will provide 5-10 billion live bacteria daily. We have gotten a great deal of positive feedback on BB536 a special Bifidobacteria in the RevitalX Probiotic with BB536 from Natural Factors.

Thanks!","I was recently diagnosed with PCOS.  I work in a gyne office, so I have been lucky in not having to pay for my testing.  Before I was diagnosed, I was on depo for 8 years.  I had my last shot on November 3, 2005.  On November 6, 2006 I went to work, and asked if I could get a sono to see how bad the supposed cysts that I had on my ovaries were.  I did not have a period the whole time I was on depo, and was starting to get anxious about my period not starting.  My husband I are ttc.  When they did the sono, I did not have any cysts.  This was a huge relief.  I don't know if it was the decreased stress or what, but that night my period started.  At first I thought that this was from the sono because it was vaginal, but I went to work the next day and asked.  It was finally my period!  I am now on a waiting list to see an endocrinologist about the PSOC, but I still do not know for sure if I really have it.

NOW my son is going through this and he is in the 3rd grade. I just cant even stand this. I have gone to the teachers and they say that he is fine and no one messes with him. Well teachers dont always see everything that goes on. Same thing in my case. The teachers never always saw what was going on. He has Aspergers Syndrome which is a high functioning autism, so Im sure he is an easier target for them. What advice can I give him. I just dont know what to say to him exactly.","If you went to the teachers and nothing was done, you need to go straight to the principal.  A lot of teachers may resent the idea that they have to ""raise"" children, because it's their job only to educate, so they may be ignoring problems, or training themselves to overlook them because it's easier.  Your son deserves to get an education within a safe environment.  Adults would get ""charged"" with creating a hostile work environment, so it should be no different.  If nothing changes, go to the school board.  Raise heck!! And don't stop until it changes.

Bullies *are* insecure with themselves, but sometimes it's hard to stand up for yourself when you feel cornered by everyone.  I was always told to ignore it, but it never stopped them from following me down the hall until the bell rang.

The most important suggestion I have is to talk to your doctor. There are medications that are approved for use during pregnancy. But even if you don't want to take medication, just talking to your doctor can help. You could also see about getting a referal for a therapist who can help you talk through your stress and develop healthy ways for coping with it.

Other ways to deal with depression include confiding in a good friend, keeping a journal, focusing on something positive and sometimes even just sitting down and having a good cry.

What you are feeling is okay and understandable. But in order to continue caring for your family and to ensure the health of the baby you are carrying - I strongly urge you to see your doctor sooner rather than later.","stress, borderline depression",,Female,,,,,,"I can barely help myself.

Somebody mention the link http://background-records.net/ as a good place to find info online.
